Linux Gaming Central is dedicated to giving you news on the Linux gaming
front.

I was a long-time editor at [Boiling Steam](https://boilingsteam.com/), a web site dedicated to Linux gaming, from 2015-2022. I've done [game reviews](https://boilingsteam.com/horizon-zero-dawn-review-with-proton-on-linux/),
hardware reviews on laptops from companies like [System76](https://boilingsteam.com/galago-pro-the-lightweight-powerhouse-from-system76/) and [Tuxedo Computers](https://boilingsteam.com/tuxedo-stellaris-the-meanest-laptop-money-can-buy/),
voiced a few different opinions, such as [whether Proton (the compatibility layer that allows Windows-based games to run on Linux) has killed native Linux gaming](https://boilingsteam.com/proton-the-native-port-killer/), covered news topics on such things as the [Steam Deck](https://boilingsteam.com/steam-deck-benchmarks-battery-life-and-more/), and so much more.

I also happen to be a freelance script writer for [Gardiner Byrant](https://www.youtube.com/c/GardinerBryant) (formerly known as The Linux Gamer), a popular YouTuber who's been reporting on the Linux gaming scene since 2014. If he's talked about the Steam Deck in one of his videos, chances are I wrote the script for it. [Here's an example](https://youtu.be/MSkcNwI993s).

Despite the name of the site, it's not exclusively for Linux and Linux gaming. I may *occassionally* touch on console gaming. Like reviews on Nintendo Switch games, for example.

Linux Gaming Central was launched in March of 2022, powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Terminal theme by [panr](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal). Comments powered by [Cactus Comments](https://cactus.chat/), using the
[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) protocol. Web site source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/linuxgamingcentral/website) and licensed under AGPLv3.

LGC uses [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io).
