I welcome feedback. But in light of some of the many comments I've received over the past couple of weeks, there's something I need to be transparent about: the comments that I approve and the ones I don't.

There's a difference between a worth*while* comment and a worth*less* one. See, the great thing about comments here on LGC, is you don't need to have an account to make a comment. Neither is there any sort of moderation queue that needs my approval prior to your comment getting posted.

I'd say a good 90% of the comments I get are relevant to the post, and even if the commenter disagrees with a take that I might have on a certain topic, I by all means welcome that. In fact, I even *encourage* commenters to have a different opinion than I do; it's great to get another person's perspective on a matter.

The catch, however, is the comment needs to be said *respectfully*. I don't welcome comments that are thoughtless -- examples might include "I'm not reading this worthless trash; you have no idea what you're talking about," or "This is your worst take I've ever read, and I am unsubscribing from your blog." For all I know, you might actually be *right* on your opinion. But I would remove that comment nonetheless -- especially if you don't give a reason for *why* you feel that way -- for the sake of my sanity. It's the same reason why I don't read comments on posts that I submit on Reddit.

Again, I greatly appreciate the community's thoughts on posts that I submit. I'm always interested in knowing what people are thinking. But just be aware, a worthless comment is going straight to the bin. So, if you ever notice your comment removed, you now know why. I've updated the [About](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/about/) page with this information.

**TL;DR** Comments on articles are greatly appreciated, but please make your comment in a polite and respectful manner.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
