I invite you to take a look at the first step in the interview process at Canonical:

Read that for a few minutes and tell me whether the interview process is absurd, or someone at Canonical has just too much time on their hands.

First, the spelling error in the first sentence: "to *joint* the Ubuntu WSL engineering team." Second, "very occasionally." It should just be "occasionally." Third, the long, *long*, list of questions. Fourth, the need to create a PDF of the answers. Fifth, questions about high school? Why would anyone need any information on high school experiences?

Sixth, why does the interviewee need to list Canonical's competitors? Shouldn't Canonical already know that? Seventh...okay I could just go on and on here. Makes me curious what the interview process is like at Mozilla.

Someone had [shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/th5eou/this_was_the_first_step_in_the_interview_process/) this on Reddit. Get yourself a good laugh by reading some of the comments. After looking at that extensive list of questions, the interviewee made a good move by withdrawing their application.

It's part of the reason people like Alan Pope and Martin Wimpress [left Canonical](https://medium.com/@JadeTheDev/canonical-120a9d880997) a while ago. Canonical ignores bugs, continues to push Snaps, and overall seems to not care about anyone in the company or the end-user. Like I said before, [Canonical has done a lot in the past to make the Linux desktop what it is today](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/fedora_the_new_ubuntu/), but sadly the tables have flipped, and the money-hungry CEO steps in to make everyone's experience miserable.
