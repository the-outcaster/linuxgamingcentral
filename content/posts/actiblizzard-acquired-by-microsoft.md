After nearly two years, much opposition, and $68.7 billion spent, it seems like the ActiBlizzard acquisition by Microsoft [has finally completed today](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/10/13/xbox-activision-blizzard/). Activision CEO Bobby Kotick will stay on board "until at least the end of 2023," reports [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/23915545/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-close). CoD will remain on PlayStation and Nintendo platforms for 10 years, and will likely be available on Game Pass sometime next year. (It does make me wonder though how they're going to be able to run a modern CoD game on a nearly 10-year-old SoC with just 4 GB of RAM.)

Perhaps this may be a bit of a controversial opinion, but I do see some good coming out of this deal. I can see the Battle.NET launcher being retired in favor of moving Blizzard games over to Steam, like they did with *Overwatch 2*. One less launcher to deal with is always a great thing. And maybe Microsoft will have some interest in renewing some of Activision's other IPs, such as *Tony Hawk's Pro Skater* (which finally arrived on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395210/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_1__2/) this month) and *Crash Bandicoot*.

I'd like to know what you think though. Do you think the acquisition was a good move? Or do you think Microsoft just wants to have their own monopoly where they want to own everything?
