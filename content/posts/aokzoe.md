Since the announcement of the Steam Deck, portable PC gaming consoles have been proliferating the market. We have another one coming next month: the [AOKZOE](https://aokzoestore.com/) (pronounced "a-okay-zoey"). AOK is translated into English as "perfect," while ZOE is translated as "sports life." Devices start shipping in September.

From the photos I was sent it looks like this handheld will have a kickstand. The color of the face buttons kind of reminds me of the SNES controller. It also looks like it has a USB 3.0 port, a USB-C port for charging, and a headphone jack. The power and volume buttons are placed similarly to where they are on the Deck.

Here are the specs:

So it looks like it will come with a Ryzen 7 6800U APU with Radeon 680M graphics, and 16-to-32 GB of LPDDR5X RAM (I'm guessing there will be differents SKUs available). The display is 1920 x 1200 and measures 8", with a brightness of up to 380 nits. It comes with a 48 Wh battery, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5, and has a built-in gyroscope. Seems like the APU is capable of rendering *Elden Ring* at an average of 30 FPS on medium settings at 1080p resolution, based on some [gameplay footage by ShadowSeven](https://youtu.be/82ip-bHctIY) from a laptop with the same APU. AOKZOE has their own YouTube channel showing off [*Forza Horizon 5*](https://youtu.be/40AfK4CSxBw) at 1200p at high settings. Seems to mostly fluctuate at 50 FPS.

So the AOKZOE will have a larger resolution, a bigger battery, and a larger display than the Deck. Not surprisingly the price hasn't been revealed just yet, but if I were to take a guess it would be at least $800. Probably more like $1,000. There also isn't any mention on their site as to how much storage it will come with. But I guess the good news is as you can see in the cover photo, SteamOS will be supported.

I'll be keeping my eyes on this one, as I may be getting a review unit. If you're in the Q3 or later category for waiting for your Steam Deck, or the device isn't available in your country, the AOKZOE may be that itch you want to scratch.
