Small update out for Beta and Preview Steam Deck-ers. Today's Deck client update (beta) mostly focuses on improving the offline experience. Patch notes are as follows:
- Fixed issue where rebooting while in Steam Offline Mode would cause games to fail to launch
- Fixed the Cloud Sync error notification popping up when offline
- Disabled Steam Offline Mode button when not connected to the internet, as trying to do this currently gets Steam Deck into a bad state.
  -  This change disables this button but does not in any way affect your ability to play games without an active Internet connection.
  
The patch notes also mention the following:
> We're continuing to look at making the user experience of playing games without an Internet connection a better, more intuitive experience.

Pretty good news, as most of the time I don't think people are going to have Internet with them on their travels.
