First mentioned by [GamingOnLinux](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/this-steam-deck-durability-test-had-me-watching-in-horror/), I decided to take a look at the video featured in the article. It was a YouTuber by the name of JerryRigEverything who recently posted a [video](https://youtu.be/66xbBtnxb5k) of cutting across the Steam Deck...with a pocket knife.

Normally when you get that fancy new electronic device, you prize it so much that you'd do everything in your power to keep it safe from scratches or other types of damage. Yeah, it might collect some dust once it's been put on the shelf after a while, but you wouldn't do anything as bad as what this guy did.

I didn't take too many notes while watching. I was too much in a cringe state as he sliced his way across the A and B buttons, the touchpads, the thumbsticks, the tiny buttons below the touchpads, and the back of the Deck. He even put a lighter right on the screen and left it there for a good ten seconds or so, then tried to break the device in half (fortunately it didn't work). The video was more so a test of being able to watch it in its entirety rather than actually observing how well the device can withstand scratches. I couldn't help but let out a small shriek as he carved his way across the outer ring of the analog stick. It was hard enough just screencapping the cover photo for this post.

But, if you can withstand it, you might actually learn a thing or two out of it, once you get the Deck or if you already have it. At least you'll know how well the Deck can handle physical damage.
