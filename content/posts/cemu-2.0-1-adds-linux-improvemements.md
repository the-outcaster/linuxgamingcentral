Since the news about [Cemu going open-source and available for Linux](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/cemu-now-open-source-and-available-for-linux/) went viral a few weeks ago, we're already starting to see improvements to the Wii U emulator with version 2.0-1.

To start, the update is mostly bug fix-related. Many of the issues present with 2.0 should no longer be a problem with this update. The patch notes also mention "lots of smaller Linux improvements," although it doesn't go into detail concerning what exactly has been improved. I suppose you could check the [commit history](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/commits/) if you want all the details. The developers mention that "we are still working on additional distribution formats (AppImage/Flatpak)."

Apparently a [recent Wii U firmware update](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/08/wii-u-receives-its-first-system-update-of-2022-heres-whats-included) has screwed things around for people with North American Nintendo accounts who wanted to play online. That problem is now fixed.

See the patch notes on [Cemu's official site](https://cemu.info/changelog.html). Also, be sure to check out Steam Deck HQ's [guide](https://steamdeckhq.com/tips-and-guides/how-to-play-wii-u-games-dual-screen-using-cemu/) on getting Wii U games set up on Deck!
