Cemu 2.0-18 came out yesterday. Notable features with this update include the option to delete shader cache from the context menu, simplified Vulkan "swapchain code," the dropdown combobox on the Linux version should now work, and fixed resource path for the AppImage. Some other smaller bug fixes landed as well.
