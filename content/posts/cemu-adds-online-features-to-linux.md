Cemu -- the Wii U emulator that recently went [open-source while at the same time adding support for Linux](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/cemu-now-open-source-and-available-for-linux/) -- recently received a commit to add online features for the Linux version. Going by the [pull request](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/pull/486), it seems like there was very little back and forth to it. One of the developers commented, "Looks good to me. No regressions encountered while testing on Windows." As such, the PR has been merged into the main branch and already available for [download](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases/tag/v2.0-16).

Now that Cemu provides an AppImage, it should be easier than ever to get Wii U emulation up and running on Linux, and now it's cross-compatible with the Windows build as far as online capabilities. See the [commit](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/commit/b1c70588fe3f1cdee936ea2d6d83c6170e6c4ab8) for more info.
