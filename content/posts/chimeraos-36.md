New release of [ChimeraOS](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/interview-with-chimeraos-devs/) is out. It's rather small, but does add a few new features, including the ability to add Wii ROMs via the Chimera app, as well as being able to "select additional artwork on emulated games" for the Steam Deck UI.

Some fixes have also been added:
- Fixed missing Text Editor shortcut in desktop mode
- Fixed artwork selection for emulated games
- Fixed additional artwork for Steam games not downloading or applying under certain conditions
- Fixed external monitor not working on Gamepad/Deck UI

Finally, non-Steam shortcuts marked as "hidden" will no longer appear in the Deck UI.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/Release-Notes#chimeraos-36-2022-11-11). Be sure to check out the recent [interview](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/interview-with-chimeraos-devs/) that I had with a few of the developers!

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
