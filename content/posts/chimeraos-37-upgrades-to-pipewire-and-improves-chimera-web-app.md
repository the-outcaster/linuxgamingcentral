New update for the *awesome* couch-oriented gaming distro ChimeraOS has come upon us. Included in this update:
- switch from PulseAudio to PipeWire
- Chimera web app has increased responsiveness
- desktop mode (which was introduced with [version 35](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/chimeraos-35/)) adds support for additional languages, adds "Disks" and "Archive Manager" tools, and switches "Terminal" to "Console"

Several fixes have been made:
- fixed non-Steam shortcut issues caused by game database update failures
- fixed system update failures when resuming downloads
- fixed restarting Steam from the Chimera web app with Gamepad/Deck UI

Some features from the Chimera web app are now being deprecated "as part of the phasing out of Big Picture Mode":
- virtual keyboard
- performance overlay/MangoHud toggle and settings
- Steam overlay toggle
- compositor/window mode toggle
