There's another [Crankshaft](https://crankshaft.space) plugin that I wanted to highlight: [Compatibility Tools Manager](https://git.sr.ht/~avery/compatibility-tools-manager). With this plugin installed on the Steam Deck, you can quickly obtain the latest version of GE-Proton without having to resort to Desktop Mode. Just install it, then you will be prompted to restart the Deck. It's that simple.

You can see here after installing the latest version (7-28 at the time of writing this) and restarting the Deck, it's now available in the compatibility list. With the same plugin I can also remove any installed versions that I have.

That's all I wanted to say. If you're on desktop, you can refer to my [ProtonUp-Qt guide](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton_ge_tutorial/) for getting GE-Proton installed.
