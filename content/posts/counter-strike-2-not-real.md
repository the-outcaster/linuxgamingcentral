Journalists seem to be a bit too excited making the headlines about this. According to a [GeForce Experience/NVIDIA driver leak](https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1631075971976642560), dataminers have found an executable file named "csgos2.exe". This led some people to believe Valve was working on a successor to *CS:GO*. What made matters worse, is Richard Lewis wrote a [post](https://richardlewis.substack.com/p/sources-yes-counter-strike-2-is-real) saying that *Counter-Strike 2* is real and "round the corner," further fueling the fire for *Counter-Strike* fans to get excited.

Hate to burst your bubble, but **this isn't the case.** The "CS2" reference in the NVIDIA leak is actually a reference to a project that ended development in 2009 -- which, according to [Tyler McVicker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2c7HiEwKFU), was headed by [Minh-Le](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minh_Le), one of the co-creators of the *Counter-Strike* series. This project would later be picked up on and be known as [*Tactical Intervention*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_Intervention). Valve apparently sent hardware "to third-parties to be able to test and prepare themselves for the *Counter-Strike* source to build" but that hardware contained this "CS2" executable file.

The reality is *CS:GO* is actually getting ported to Source 2. This will allow official and workshop developers "access to the incredibly improved Source 2 tools" for expanded in-game content. This has been a long time in the making, but evidently we'll be seeing "public releases and announcements" within the next two months.

See Tyler's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2c7HiEwKFU) for more details.
