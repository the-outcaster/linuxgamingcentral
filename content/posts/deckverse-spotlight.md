There's a YouTuber who you may not be aware of: [The Deckverse](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDeckverse/featured). As you might have guessed from the name, The Deckverse (Timo) focuses on Steam Deck content. Things like:
- a deep-dive into *Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered* - [what the best settings are between performance and battery life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CKsRN_2B0A)
- optimized settings for [*Dying Light 2*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z89xo_C3P3c)
- *Hades* [tweaks and tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmpQdWZWQK4)
- *Outriders Worldslayer* [benchmarks and optimized settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrpeCvw5WrE)

Perhaps what he is most well-known for is the [Golden 40](https://youtu.be/DA2EqFqIPM4) video. He explains why setting the Deck's refresh rate to 40 Hz is the optimal setting for most games when it comes to balancing the most battery power, retaining much of the same graphics quality, and still having a decent gaming experience. The video is even broken down into segments so you can quickly jump to the section that you're interested in. More recently, he posted a [short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wfkPf6D6znQ) going over an upcoming game: *Dredge*, and why he recommends playing it on Deck. Finally, he occasionally does [giveaways](https://youtu.be/3fJBDwNm0M8).

The video quality is fantastic: the lighting is great, and he has some pretty decent video editing skills. I highly recommend subscribing for quality Steam Deck content! In the meantime Timo also has the following:
- [Official website (under construction)](https://www.deckver.se/)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TDeckverse)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/E2BmFhA3gT)
- [Steam Group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/TheDeckverse)

He's working on some exclusive content right now, such as unannounced official Steam Deck presets for popular games and an exclusive interview with someone involved in the Deck production. Timo is often caught up by family and two jobs next to this project, so bear in mind that it might be slow at times for new content to be released.
