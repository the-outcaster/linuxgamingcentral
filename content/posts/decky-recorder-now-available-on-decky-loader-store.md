Great news. [Decky Recorder](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/decky-recorder/) is now available in the Decky Loader store. You can now easily install this handy plugin without having to manually download, copy, and configure permissions. Simply head over to the Decky Loader store from the top-right in the Quick Access Menu to get started.

In addition, there's a new [update](https://github.com/marissa999/decky-recorder/releases/tag/0.1.0). You can now choose what format the recording will be saved as. By default it's MP4, but you can also choose Matroska or QuickTime.

From what it looks like, the developer of the plugin is looking into options for [saving recordings to a MicroSD card](https://github.com/marissa999/decky-recorder/issues/6), so that will be another feature to look forward to.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
