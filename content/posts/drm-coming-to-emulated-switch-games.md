Denuvo knows how to ruin everything about the digital gaming economy. Just a few months ago they started [DRM'ing DLC](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/news-for-july-2-8/). Now they're expanding to [emulated Nintendo Switch games](https://irdeto.com/news/denuvo-by-irdeto-launches-the-industrys-first-nintendo-switch-emulator-protection/). How on earth they're going to be able to figure that out is beyond me.

> By preventing piracy on Switch while blocking unauthorized emulations on PC, studios are able to increase their revenue during the game launch window, which is the most important period in regard to monetization. The Nintendo Switch Emulator Protection will ensure that anyone wishing to play the game has to buy a legitimate copy.

Supposedly the technology "integrates seamlessly into the build toolchain with no impact on the gaming experience. It then allows for the insertion of checks into the code, which blocks gameplay on emulators."

Seems like Denuvo is trying to eff with us, just for the sake of pissing us off. Just because a Nintendo Switch game can be emulated on Linux, it *doesn't* mean the game was pirated. Mind you, it's *totally* legal to have a launch edition Switch, buy games via physical cartridge or through the eShop, and dump the game via homebrew. I guess the guys over at Irdeto don't understand that. Plus, emulated games offer higher framerates, resolutions, and mod support. I feel like these kind of measures will only *encourage* piracy all the more so.
