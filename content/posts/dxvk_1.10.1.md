[DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) -- a translation layer that converts Direct3D calls into Vulkan, and a major component of Valve's Proton project -- was recently updated this weekend to [1.10.1](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10.1). This adds video playback support in a few Koei Tecmo games (particularly for the *Atelier* series and *Nioh 2*), and apparently supports the D3D11-based UI in the Windows version of *Black Mesa* (note that *Black Mesa* is natively available on Linux).

DXVK 1.10.1 also includes a series of bug fixes and improvements. This includes potential performance improvements in some D3D11 games on NVIDIA, D3D9 texture upload fixes, better performance with *Frostpunk* and a few *Assassin's Creed* titles, and various fixes for *God of War*, *GTA: San Andreas*, and *Rayman Origins*.

Read the full patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10.1). Note that you'll need to use this version of DXVK with Proton Experimental for the time being, and keep in mind the new features are experimental.
