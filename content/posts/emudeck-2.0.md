EmuDeck, the popular application for getting emulators set up on your Deck quickly and conveniently, has just received a brand new 2.0 update. Features with this update include:
- the addition of a GUI to make it easier to use
- it doesn't need to be re-installed to apply customizations, thanks to a Quick Settings menu
- saves can be backed up to the cloud
- support for Vikta3K, ScummVM, and Doom
- performance improvements across all emulators
- revamped controller schemes and hotkeys
- bug fixes and "under the hood" improvements

Best place I could find the patch notes was on their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EmuDeck/status/1581664011581411329). A few months ago I tested [Ryujinx vs. Yuzu](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ryujinx-vs-yuzu-tested-on-deck/) using EmuDeck if you're interested.
