Nice new update out for EmuDeck, the ultimate emulation solution for the Steam Deck. Today is the release of 2.1.0, and with it comes the following:
- homebrew games can be installed or removed one game at a time (note that currently they're only playable with EmulationStation)
- new home screen
- retro achievements for PS1 and PS2
- support for new emulators: MelonDS standalone, Mupen, mGBA, Cemu as an AppImage, PicoB and tic80 RetroArch cores
- ROMs and BIOS can now be imported via a USB flash drive
- EmulationStation 2.0 with a new EpicNoir theme
- EmuDeck no longer needs to be re-installed when an emulator has a new config update
- EmuDeck installation can be transferred to MicroSD card, external drive, etc.
- cloud services such as Apple TV, Disney+, Hulu, etc. can now be added as Steam shortcuts
- two new themes for Steam ROM manager; one for regular users, the other for more advanced users
- automatic Steam Input profile integration
- several bug fixes

If you look at their homebrew store it looks like they have a lot more games than they previously have before!

It's an overall excellent update. I especially appreciate the fact that emulator configs can now be updated with the press of one button; no need to re-install EmuDeck again! Same with the emulators themselves: updates can be downloaded on the fly now with the click of a single button.

If you have [EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com/) installed, just run it and it will automatically download the new update.
