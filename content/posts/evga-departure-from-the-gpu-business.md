As I'm sure many of you are aware, EVGA is no longer making video cards. Gamers Nexus took the flight to Taiwan to document EVGA's final days on making their last video card, seeing it get burnt to hell, then "resurrecting" it back to life and making it the most powerful 4090 there ever was. Per the video description:
> This video documents the behind-the-scenes of the EVGA GPU division. The company has exited manufacturing video cards, but for now, the crew remains at EVGA working on final projects and supporting customers. We were given the unique and privileged opportunity to tour EVGA's repair center, film processes previously secret, and show the teamwork that went into building EVGA.

You'll see cards getting built by hand, including the sanding process that apparently takes *two hours*. You'll see video cards getting set on fire, and EVGA being able to salvage the card via a "baking" and "re-balling" process. Really interesting video on the secrets behind the GPU industry, including how EVGA is so effective at their RMA process.
