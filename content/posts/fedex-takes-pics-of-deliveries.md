For those who are still waiting on their Decks to arrive, know that I feel your pain. I had to wait a long time too. But if there's any sort of comfort that I can give, it would be that FedEx -- the company responsible for shipping Valve's handheld PC -- will soon be rolling out a program for delivery drivers to [take photos of their deliveries](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/22/23178645/fedex-delivery-photo-proof-front-door), proving that they actually delivered to the customer. Some people have been reporting over on [r/SteamDeck](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/u7mgxt/i_am_98_certain_fedex_attempted_to_steal_my_steam/) that FedEx *may* have stolen their Deck. Fortunately that didn't happen in my case, but this additional step should definitely help confirm to customers that their package was indeed delivered.

Amazon had already been rolling out a similar program back in 2018, but good to see FedEx doing the same. The post from The Verge doesn't say when it will be happening other than "soon." It also will only be available in the US and Canada.
