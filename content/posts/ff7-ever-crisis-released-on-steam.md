So, *Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis* just landed on Steam as of yesterday. The first thing you're probably going to want to do, is **if you have a MicroSD card, install the game on that.** When I got through the first mission the game complained that I didn't have enough storage to download the rest of the in-game content when I had it installed on the internal SSD. The game only needs 6.5 GB to download, and since my SSD has 300+ GB of space left, I have *plenty* of storage room left. One user on the [Steam forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2484110/discussions/0/4038103255308852095/) suggested moving the game install to a MicroSD card to get rid of the issue. Oddly enough, this worked -- just keep in mind there's no Steam cloud support, so you'll want to backup your save file and put it onto the MicroSD card to pick up where you left off.

Just as a reminder, to transfer a game from the SSD to the MicroSD card and vice versa, go to Settings -> Storage -> Select game -> Press Y -> Transfer the game to the selected storage medium.

Judging by the fact that it's a mobile port, it runs pretty great on Steam Deck, as expected, performance-wise. Ultra settings, 1280 x 720 resolution, 120 Hz in most areas except for cutscenes, and still only consuming about 10 W of battery (6 W TDP with 500 MHz GPU clock frequency). As far as controls, however, there's no built-in controller support, so you'll have to stick to the default keyboard profile that Steam Input uses, and even then, you're probably going to want to adjust some of the controls to different keyboard actions (like Return on the A button, for example). The touch screen, of course, is always an option too. You can see my template below as an example -- X, Y, and B do magic attacks, left shoulder activates defense mode, right shoulder activates Limit Break, etc.
