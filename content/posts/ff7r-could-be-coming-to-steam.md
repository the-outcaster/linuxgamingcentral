*UPDATE: FF7R Steam store page is now [live](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/), and what's more, it will be Deck Verified! Game launches about five hours from now.*

*Final Fantasy 7* is getting a [25th-anniversary stream](https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1535185214938435584) later today. The stream is only going to be 10 minutes but based on recent activity on [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/1462040/history/), as well as speculation on [r/GamingLeaksAndRumors](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/vdbxro/after_going_14_days_without_an_update_the_likely/), we *could* be seeing *Final Fantasy 7 Remake* on Steam, or at least have an announcement about it. The remake has been on the Epic Games Store for exactly six months. I don't know if I want to believe the game will immediately be available on Steam, as Epic exclusives tend to last for at least a year.

At any rate, *FF7R* coming to Steam should be good news for those of you who refuse to use EGS. And hopefully Square Enix won't charge the same $70 price tag that they did on Epic for a barebones PC port. Game works great with vanilla Wine and by forcing DirectX 11.
