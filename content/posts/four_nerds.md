Gardiner Byrant, Liam Dawe from GamingOnLinux, Jason Evangelho from Forbes, and Nick from The Linux Experiment got together to discuss their thoughts about the Steam Deck and how it has changed their gaming habits. They also talk about the future of native Linux games, inform Jason about the Steam Machine initiative and what happened to them.

There's apparently a lot more that they talked about, as so far Liam and Gardiner have only uploaded small clips of the entire discussion. Full episode will go live later today.

I recommend giving it a listen, it's pretty entertaining.
