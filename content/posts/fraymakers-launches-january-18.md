[*Fraymakers*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1420350/Fraymakers/) is a game that I've been following closely. It's basically a pixel-art platform fighter with mechanics that are akin to the *Smash Brothers* series. The team behind it is [McLeodGaming](https://www.mcleodgaming.com/), who also made *Super Smash Flash* and *Super Smash Flash 2*.

This was originally slated to be released in Early Access on Steam back in August. It's been pushed back and now we've finally got a release date: [January 18th](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1420350/view/3607977852739517701?l=english). It will include:
- four characters
- 20 assists
- five stages
- rollback netcode!
- FrayTools -- I'm guessing this is for modding purposes

Later on there will be five more characters, one DLC character, 30 assists, nine stages, and more. And it looks like according to their [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mcleodgaming/fraymakers-the-infinitely-replayable-indie-platform-fighter) there will be a *native* Linux release in addition to the Mac OS and Windows versions.

I'm certainly looking forward to getting my hands on this game!
