Holy cow, that [FSR 2.1 article](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/dlss-unlocker-for-various-games/) has proven to be quite a hit. It's already my third most-viewed article on the entire site. As such I wanted to follow up and actually put FSR 2.1 to the test on Steam Deck, to see whether or not it could live up to the claims I previously brought out.

I'm again using [*Kena: Bridge of Spirits*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review/) as the test sample. The only other game I have in my library that I can test FSR 2.1 with the DLSS unlocker mod is *Horizon Zero Dawn*, which I will probably save for another day. The video comparison between FSR 1.0 and 2.1 is available to view on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvU8GTUxErw). *Kena* was tested with [GE-Proton7-37](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ge-proton7-37-brings-fsr-back/), Medium graphics settings, FSR 2.1 set to "Balanced," and resolution set to the lowest available (1024 x 768). Some notes I wanted to extract from the comparison:
- FSR 2.1 performs much better -- 10, sometimes even 15 FPS higher (getting 40-45 FPS on average!)
- VRAM and RAM usage is about the same, unlike with my NVIDIA GPU
- about two watts more of CPU is used on FSR 2.1, but uses about one watt less of GPU
- battery usage on both versions is about 25 watts
- it's a bit hard to notice, but the graphics quality on FSR 2.1 is slightly better

I'll have to do some more extensive testing to see if 2.1 actually provides a longer battery life (I'll also need to observe fan speed between the two versions). In the meantime, for those of who were reporting poor framerates for *Kena* on Deck, now you've got your answer! You've got smoother gameplay and better sharpening detail. You can even get away with the High graphics preset at around 30 FPS.

Refer to my [guide](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/dlss-unlocker-for-various-games/) if you want to get this up and running yourself. I can verify that the steps used on desktop are identical when applying them to the Steam Deck.
