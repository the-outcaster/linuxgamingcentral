Yesterday eXtremeRate uploaded a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tBE10fSYBc) going over how to replace both the front and back of the Steam Deck casing.

Replacing the back part of the shell is a very simple process: just take out the eight screws holding it in, gently pry it out (but make sure the MicroSD card is taken out if there is one in the slot), and screw the new shell in. [Read: [JSAUX clear shell review](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/jsaux-clear-case-for-steam-deck-review/)] Replacing the front, however, is an entirely more complicated process. *Everything*, including the glued in battery and the screen, has to get taken out.

Still, if you're feeling bold, eXtremeRate has a full video guide out now, and it's over an hour long. The first 25 minutes or so goes over the full disassembly of the Deck. The rest of the video explains how to apply the new shell on. In addition to a Phillips screwdriver, you'll also need a heatgun or hair dryer to take the screen off, as well as tweezers to uncover the foil tape that covers the hidden screw on the heat shield. A suction cup and a couple of picks will also help prying off the screen.

Fortunately in regards to the battery, you don't actually have to pry it out. After taking the screen out, you can unscrew the screws holding the gray-colored "housing" which contains the battery, then easily replace it in the new shell.

eXtremeRate shells will be available to [order](https://extremerate.com/products/white-custom-full-set-shell-with-buttons-for-steam-deck-console) later this month and will be available in white, purple blue, clear purple, clear black, and clear. Prices start at $36, depending on what color you choose.

JSAUX is also making [fully transparent shells](https://www.reddit.com/r/JSAUX/comments/13y957e/jsaux_updates_and_future_plans/).
