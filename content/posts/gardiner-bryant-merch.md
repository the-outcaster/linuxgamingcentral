Gardiner Bryant, formerly known as The Linux Gamer, is a [YouTuber](https://youtube.com/c/gardiner_bryant) that mostly talks about the Steam Deck. I [interviewed](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/interview-with-gardiner-bryant/) him last year. He recently asked if I'd be willing to talk about his store, to which I happily obliged. I have to admit, he's got some pretty good stuff.

He mostly sells T-shirts, although he does have a hoodie and some stickers. Almost every shirt has something to do with the Steam Deck, but the twist is they add a throwback to a retro gaming console. For instance, there's a [Sega Genesis-themed shirt](https://store.heavyelement.io/listing/it-s-the-genesis-of-something?product=46) that has the theming of the Sega Genesis logo, but says "Steam Deck". The product description is as follows:
> The Steam Deck is our favorite gaming device for emulation, so we thought "why not represent that with a commemorative shirt?"

There's many more, from the likes of the Gabe Boy, a SNES-styled shirt, and one with the Dreamcast logo. There's also a few "free software" and "open-source"-themed shirts, although I don't find them to be as appealing.

As I was browsing through his catalogue, I noticed he didn't have a GameCube-themed shirt. I told him that it was an absolute *must* to have one, and in the same day, he actually [made one](https://store.heavyelement.io/listing/cube-up-your-game?product=46). The description is an absolute killer:
> Represent your love of Steam Deck and melee the competition in this cube-inspired gaming shirt.

It was so good I actually bought one...and I'm expecting it within the next couple of days. Note that you can also adjust the color of the apparel to your liking.

So, if you like both the Steam Deck and retro consoles, I think you might actually enjoy these designs. Head over to [Gardiner's store](https://store.heavyelement.io/) to see what he's got! Use the code `LGCFRIENDS` until April 22nd for 10% off!
