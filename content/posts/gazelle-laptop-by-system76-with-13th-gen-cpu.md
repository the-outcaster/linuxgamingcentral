The Gazelle laptop by System76 gets a new coat of paint. It sports the RTX 3050 and the i9-13900H. The 13900H has 14 cores, 20 threads, and a max clock speed of 5.4 GHz. System76 claims this newer processor performs "up to 8% faster" than the previous generation of Gazelle laptops. Up to 64 GB DDR4 RAM can be configured.

15" and 17" models are available, and the refresh rate for both is 144 Hz. Up to three external monitors can be connected. The laptop can be configured with PCIe 4 or 3 NVMe storage -- up to 4 TB of each class can be equipped.

Unfortunately -- but somewhat expectedly -- there are no AMD options available. Doesn't seem like DDR5 RAM can be configured either.

The new Gazelle starts at **$1299** and will be available for purchase tomorrow. See more details on [System76's website](https://system76.com/laptops/gazelle).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
