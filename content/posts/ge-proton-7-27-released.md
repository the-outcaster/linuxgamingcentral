Pretty big release for GE-Proton today, and it seems like it mostly centers around getting some more issues with *Halo Infinite* fixed.

First, `dxvk`, `vkd3d-proton`, and Wine have all been updated to the latest git. All three components have gotten the necessary patches for *Halo Infinite* merged. The campaign mode is playable now (even though it was technically working before, based on some reports I heard) and apparently there's no need to rename or delete the video files anymore. `dxvk-async` also got a patch submitted here. Keep in mind that the mouse cursor is still stuck at the center of the screen, and random freezes or hangs are to be expected.

Continuing on with the *Halo* series, Protonfixes have been added to *Halo CE*, *Halo 2*, *Halo 3*, and *Halo 3: ODST*. The mod tools are working with all of them now, except for *Halo 2*. Additionally, Protonfixes were added, updated, or removed for some other titles, including *Fall Guys*, *Witcher 2*, *Far Cry 3*, *Battlefield Bad Company 2*, *Endless Space 2*, *Gwent: Rogue Mage*, and *SQUAD*.
