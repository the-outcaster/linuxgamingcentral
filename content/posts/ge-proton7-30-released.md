Small update to GE-Proton today. Besides the usual components being upgraded to the latest git (dxvk, vkd3d-proton, wine), some other features have been added. Patch notes are as follows:
- protonfix for *Flatout Ultimate Carnage* (single player only) added -- thanks Ranplayer
- Amazon games patch added (this is mainly for possible future compatibility, please use wine-ge for non-Steam games)
- wine-staging ddraw-Device_Caps and ddraw-version-check patchsets disabled in favor of new Proton ddraw changes.
- dxvk updated to latest git
- vkd3d-proton updated to latest git
- wine updated to latest bleeding-edge
- upstream openxr patches applied
