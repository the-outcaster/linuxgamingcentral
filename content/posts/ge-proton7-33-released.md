Remember that so-called ["Quality of Life" update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/8870/view/3335500006865769804) that 2K recently pushed out for the *BioShock* series? Remember how it added a launcher and as a result got review bombed on Steam? Remember how it broke Proton compatibility?

Well, GE-Proton7-33 is here to the rescue. Yes, you'll still have to deal with the launcher, but the games should now work. Not only this, but *Red Dead Redemption 2* and *Grand Theft Auto V* have also received fixes, thanks to GE-Proton7-33 pulling in the latest changes from Wine.

In addition to [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) and [VKD3D](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton) getting updated to the latest git, the Protonfix for *Fall Guys* has been fixed (heh, ironic?), and the *Divinity Original Sin 2* launcher Protonfix has been removed. Instructions are provided on the release notes to return the latter game files back to normal.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-33). See LGC's guide for easily installing GE-Proton on [desktop](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton_ge_tutorial/). There's also a [Crankshaft plugin](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/compatibility-tools-manager-crankshaft-plugin/) that you can use on the Deck for doing the same thing.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
