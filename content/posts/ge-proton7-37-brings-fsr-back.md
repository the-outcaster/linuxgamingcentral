Good news for those of you who want to make use of FSR. The [previous release of GE-Proton](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ge-proton7-36/) temporarily took the feature away. Just a few days later, FSR is now back, while retaining all the same updates as the previous version. Special thanks to Discord member **OOOOOF123** for rebasing the FSR patch!

As a refresher, GE-Proton7-36 came with the following:
- Protonfixes added for *Shatterline*, *Halo Reach* mod tools, and *Ougon Musoukyoku*
- NVAPI enablements and media-converter changes backported from upstream Proton
- DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, and Wine bleeding-edge updates

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-37). Follow my [guide](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton_ge_tutorial/) to easily install GE-Proton on your system.
