Today's update to GE-Proton doesn't seem too exciting, although we did get a few Protonfixes added for *Skeleton Boomerang* and *Re-Volt*. Protonfixes were removed for *King of Fighters* (no longer needs FPS cap) and *Squad* (no longer needs EAC workaround). A launcher fix was added for *Secret World: Legends*.

Aside from that, everything else is updates. Wine staging has been rebased. DXVK-NVAPI, DXVK, VKD3D, and the "media converter" have been updated, although the patch notes don't mention *to what* they've been updated to (presumably, they've all been updated to the latest git). Upstream build changes from Proton Experimental have been pulled in, and Wine has been updated to the "latest Proton Experimental bleeding edge."

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-42).
