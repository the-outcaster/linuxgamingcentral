New update for GE-Proton is out! Wine has been updated to the latest bleeding edge and includes the Alt+Tab fix. Wine-staging has been rebased on the latest Proton-Wine bleeding edge. [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) and [VKD3D-Proton](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton) have both been updated to the latest git and includes the HDR patches. Proton imports upstream changes; it includes the prefix sync revert/fix.

Protonfixes have been added for the following titles:
- *Pentiment* -- workaround for the launch failure
- *Stronghold* HD/Crusader/Extreme -- multiplayer fix
- *Battle Fantia Revised Edition* -- framerate fix
- *Assassin's Creed Brotherhood* -- launcher workaround
