Usually there's a flurry of subsequent releases of GE-Proton after a new one comes out. As such, I normally don't cover *every* single update that comes out, but I'd figure this one would be worth mentioning.

While [7-45](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-45) removed the "deprecated broken dxvk-async patch" due to it causing "problems with the dxvk-cache," the following 7-46 release is a little more exciting.

The following titles should now run (or, at least not crash on launch anymore):
- *Warhammer 40,000: Darktide*
- *Death Stranding*
- *God of War*
- *The Division 2*

Seems like *Monster Hunter: Rise* is still broken for now, due to "flickering compiling shaders." Probably won't be long before that gets fixed too.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-46).
