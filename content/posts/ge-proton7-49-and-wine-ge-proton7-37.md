Similar to [GE-Proton7-48](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ge-proton7-48/), not much to be seen here. VKD3D-Proton, DXVK, and the "Proton Steam client" have been updated. Proton-Wine has been updated to "bleeding-edge." But more importantly, this release also includes the [Ubisoft Connect launcher failure fix](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-experimental-update-2-1-2023/), for those of you who play games from Ubisoft.

To coincide with this release, Wine-GE-Proton was also updated to 7-37. Proton-Wine has been updated to the "latest bleeding edge" and also includes the Ubisoft Connect fix.

See the patch notes [here](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-49) and [here](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-37).
