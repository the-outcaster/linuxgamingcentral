Some Protonfixes have been removed with this release -- in particular, *Persona 4 Golden* and *Battle Fantasia*, as they are no longer needed. One Protonfix was added for *Metal Slug*; this fixes the black window.

Upstream VKD3D, font, VR client/OpenVR, Steam client, and Proton updates have been imported. Wine-staging patches have been rebased. Finally, DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, and Wine have all been updated to "latest git" or "bleeding edge."

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-50).
