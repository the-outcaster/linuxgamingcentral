Disappointed by the lackluster PC port of *The Last of Us*? Well, I think it's no longer the last of us. Not of your computer's resources, anyway. Today's update to GE-Proton updates VKD3D-Proton, which "brings in some fixes for *The Last of Us*, *Uncharted*, and a few more [titles]." You can take a look at the [commit history](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/commits/master) for VKD3D-Proton for more details. I'm not sure how much got fixed, so *The Last of Us* may work only a little better. I wouldn't know since I don't own the game.

The update to Wine (bleeding edge) adds the [EAC fix for *Fall Guys*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-experimental-update-3-31-2023/). DXVK has also been updated, though it doesn't seem like there were any specific game fixes mentioned with this update.

As for Protonfixes, one was removed for *Saints Row 2*, one was added for *Carnage Cross*, and a third was corrected for *Outlaws*. (The patch notes just says "Outlaws"; I'm assuming it's in reference to *Outlaws + A Handful of Missions* from [7-52](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ge-proton7-53/).)

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-54).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
