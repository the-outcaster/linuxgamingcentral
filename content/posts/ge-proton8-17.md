New update for GE-Proton landed earlier today. Protonfixes have been added to the following titles:
- *Alan Wake*
- *Batman Arkham Asylum*
- *Tokyo Necro*
- *The Song of Saya*
- *You and Me and Her: A Love Story*

*Rainbow Six Siege* is now able to be played again, thanks to an [upstream patch](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/3777). Keep in mind multiplayer still doesn't work because of the anti-cheat software the game uses.

Resolution calculation when using `WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR` has been fixed. GE-Proton8-17 also includes the usual set of updates to "Proton build changes," "VR changes," VKD3D-Proton, DXVK, and Wine.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-17).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
