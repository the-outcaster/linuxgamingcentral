Today's update to GE-Proton is fairly interesting. If you have any games that use DirectX 8, you can now launch them directly with GE-Proton8-24 rather than using [D8VK](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/d8vk-v1.0/). You just need to supply `PROTON_ENABLE_D8VK=1` in the game's launch parameters. Thanks to loathingKernel -- one of the contributors to the [Rare EGS launcher](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/rare-epic-games-launcher/) -- for this feature!

Aside from that, GE-Proton8-24 adds/updates fixes for *Fable III*, *Yazuka 5*, and *Farlight 84*. Video decoders have been added for *Crimson Skies* and *Mafia*. DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, and Wine have all been updated to master or bleeding-edge.

All this and more in the [patch notes](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-24). Steam Deck users can now easily install the latest version of GE-Proton with the [Wine Cellar](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/wine-cellar-steam-deck-plugin/) plugin.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
