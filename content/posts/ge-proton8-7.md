GloriousEggroll -- I mean, *Ph42oN* -- brings the glorious FSR feature back to GE-Proton. Thanks to them for bringing this back; it will definitely come in handy for Linux desktop users.

Aside from that, Protonfixes were added to *Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth* 1 and 2, and the usual set of software tools, including DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, and Proton-Wine, have been updated to the latest git. The Protonfix for *Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas* has been removed since it is no longer needed, and Ph42oN also contributed a fix for fullscreen not working properly when FSR is disabled.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-7).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
