Reddit user `Bar_Har` [spotted](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/xjbopy/spotted_genshin_impact_as_one_of_the_games_valve/) a Deck running *Genshin Impact* during the Tokyo Game Show. Apparently the game isn't available on Steam, and playing it on Linux requires disabling the anti-cheat software that it uses. And even then, your account is at risk of getting banned.

So who knows. Maybe that particular Deck was running Windows. Or, for all we know, that could just be a picture blown up in fullscreen.  Or maybe Valve *really* is working with the developers of the game to get it to run nicely on the handheld. Seems like it's mostly speculation at this point. Hi-Tech Lo-Life made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STlBZ3nosFM) a few weeks ago on getting *Genshin Impact* to run on Deck in an unofficial capacity, so have a look at that if you need some copium.
