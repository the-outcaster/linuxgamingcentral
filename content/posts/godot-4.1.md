[Godot 4](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/godot-4-released/) was a *massive* release that brought...well, too many changes, improvements, and fixes to list. Fast forward four months later and we're already seeing a big improvement to the open-source game engine with the release of 4.1.

In this update come the following:
- improved AI navigation avoidance
- the code editor can now be detached and put on other displays
- adding and removing child nodes is "several times faster"
- Vulkan renderer gets a pipeline cache which should lead to a "slight decrease in load times"
- imported models should no longer face backward
- frame delta smoothing to improve "fluidity of motion and give smoother gameplay"
- static variables can now be used
- visual shader notes and editor plugins can be made via GDExtension
- arrays of nodes can now be exported to the inspector
- easier searching of projects via the use and filtering of tags
- games can be exported to "all desktop platforms" whether it's using GDScript or C#. Games that aren't written with C# can also be exported to mobile platforms and the web
- over 900 bugs fixed
- and plenty more!

The [blog post](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-1-is-here/) mentions that, if you're migrating your project from Godot 4 to 4.1, it should be "relatively safe" to do so. There's a [migration guide](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/pull/7611) that's in the works. Make sure you back up your project before updating!

See the [curated changelog](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/4.1-stable/CHANGELOG.md) for more details.
