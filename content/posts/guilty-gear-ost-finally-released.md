I had reviewed *Guilty Gear -Strive-* on [Boiling Steam](https://boilingsteam.com/guilty-gear-strive-fighting-at-its-finest/) a little less than a year ago. In it I had mentioned how *amazing* the soundtrack is. Seems like Arc System Works was aware of that, so they deliberately held off from putting the soundtrack on Spotify or as a separate purchase on Steam.

Well, today the soundtrack [is now available for purchase](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1384160/view/3226278286752787879). There's two discs' worth of content and they're $10.99 each. While this post may sound like an advertisement, I'm only bringing it up because the soundtrack is *that* much worth listening to. Hard rock at it's finest. Great music to jam to when you're having a workout. Note that you can listen to the OST on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3IaQ0DQMIXMShbMDNepeTK?si=FkP-tlirToyujHVWYJT4Hg) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi7hwCycaAzc-mBJIgveE5qEsPra9BBT1) first to get a taste to see if you like it, then if you want to support the artist you can buy the album on Steam.

Speaking of the game itself, *Guilty Gear -Strive-* is fantastic. [There will be crossplay multiplayer between PC and PlayStation this summer](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1384160/view/3302839954737000002), and there will also be a major revamp for all characters on June 10th.
