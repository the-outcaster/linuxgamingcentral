A new version of the Heroic Games Launcher has shipped today, as a beta. That would be version 2.4.0. Included in this update are the following:
- plenty of UI/UX improvements, including a unified library between Epic Games and GOG games, a download progress bar on the left, and the ability to change game language
- several bug fixes, including the setting of controller on boot being disabled
- Linux-specific things; CrossOver support is gone, but now there's an option to display the Wine executable path
- minor cleanup of things like the game setting keys being the only thing saved to the game config file during installation

The stable 2.3.9 release has also been [updated](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.3.9) to add a fix for GOG games that use DosBox and ScummVM.

See the patch notes for the 2.4.0 beta release on [GitHub](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.4.0-beta).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
