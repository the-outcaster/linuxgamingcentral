Sweet new release of Heroic Games Launcher is out, codenamed "Nico Robin." This version comes with a DLC manager, the ability to sideload apps and games from your web browser, and the automatic downloading of Wine if it's not found on the system.

Additionally, there's half-a-dozen bug fixes, from the UI, to the download manager, and native Linux games not being added to the launcher. The login screen has also been made "more responsive," and the handling of shortcuts has been improved.

See the full patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.8.0).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
