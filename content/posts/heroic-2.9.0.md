Nearly two months after the previous release, Heroic Games Launcher 2.9.0 is now released. Amazon Games is now integrated into the launcher, giving you access to Amazon Prime games. DRM support has been added for web apps -- the patch notes mention this is for Windows and Mac OS specifically, although from the [pull request](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/2761) it looks like Linux/Steam Deck is supported as well. Now you can run streaming services like Netflix, AppleTV, Cruncyroll, and more!

Improvements have been made to the launcher's performance and stability. The Mac OS version gets Gaming Port toolkit support, ProtonDB and Steam Deck ratings have been added to the game page, you can now keep track of your playtime with GOG games, and "older" DXVK versions can be installed on older hardware.

Along with this release is eight bug fixes, such as losing your login when launching the app, GOG games now remembering their install path, "Help" menus now correctly opening, and using the Steam runtime inside Flatpak now works.

See the full patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.9.0).
