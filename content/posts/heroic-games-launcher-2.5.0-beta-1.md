A month-and-a-half after the previous release, the Heroic Games Launcher has "tons of commits" for us to look forward to. Awesome features included in this update are:
- download manager -- you can now queue as many games as you want to download while doing other tasks
- custom user themes -- different themes have already been available, but now you can make your own by using CSS
- apps outside of EGS or GOG can now be added and launched within Heroic
- "more robust" online checking system
- several fixes for the UI
- performance improvements
- improved README and "developer experience"
- refactored Settings menu/frontend/offline detection
- Linux-specific fixes, such as showing the Wine prefix in Game Settings and adding a warning if using only one dGPU if the "Use Dedicated Graphics Card" option is ticked
- shortcuts to Steam are now added automatically
- updated login design
- apps can now be sideloaded
- Legendary, the backend that powers Heroic, has been updated to [0.20.30](https://github.com/derrod/legendary/releases/tag/0.20.30)
- *plenty* of bug fixes

The patch notes mention that **you may want to clear Heroic's cache before using this version to avoid a few bugs.** On Linux, the cache is located in `~/.config/heroic/Cache/Cache_Data`.

See the full patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.5.0-beta.1).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
