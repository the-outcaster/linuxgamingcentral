Huge congrats to the Heroic team for this, well, *heroic* release! There's just so many cool new features, improvements, and bug fixes with the 2.5.0 update, codenamed "Yamato." The stable update just came out a few hours ago and contains over three months' worth of changes. Here are the highlights:
- download manager -- works similarly to Steam's download manager; introduced with [the first beta](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/heroic-games-launcher-2.5.0-beta-1/)
- sideload games and apps, even if they aren't in your Epic/GOG library
- HowLongToBeat -- introduced with [beta 3](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/heroic-games-launcher-2.5.0-beta-3/)
- custom themes with CSS, along with two new themes
- the ability to add Steam games automatically
- improved game detection from external drives
- revamped Settings and login UI
- improved UI performance, better gamepad navigation
- updates to Legendary and Electron
- *tons* of other fixes and improvements
