Though 2.5.2 might be labeled as a hotfix, it got a few features as well. Arm64 builds are now available for M1/M2 Macs. The Linux version adds support for a DXVK limit FPS option. DXVK installation has been fixed, the Wine status should now be properly updated after install or uninstall, and some fixes have been added to the UI and GOG saves.

See the full patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.5.2).
