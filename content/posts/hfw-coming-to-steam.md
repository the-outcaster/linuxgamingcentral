Great news for those of you who liked the original *Horizon Zero Dawn*. The successor, *Horizon Forbidden West*, is coming to Steam and EGS in early 2024, according to the [PlayStation blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2023/09/27/horizon-forbidden-west-complete-edition-is-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/). It was kind of an expected move from Sony, seeing as Nixxes Software ported the original one over a few years ago. The same company is doing it again, and this will also include the Burning Shores DLC, for $60.

*Horizon Zero Dawn* is marked as Steam Deck Verified. I would imagine *Forbidden West* will also be verified, or at least Playable.

You can wishlist the game now on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420110/Horizon_Forbidden_West_Complete_Edition/). You can also check out the review I wrote on *Horizon Zero Dawn* over on [Boiling Steam](https://boilingsteam.com/horizon-zero-dawn/index.html).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
