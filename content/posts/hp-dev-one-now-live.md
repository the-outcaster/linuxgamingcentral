A few weeks ago I had mentioned [HP collaborating with the team at System76 to bring Pop!_OS to the HP Dev One laptop](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/news-hp-teams-with-system76/). Well, you can now purchase the laptop on the [official site](https://hpdevone.com).

“System76 is thrilled to work with HP to advance open source and bring the Linux desktop to a much wider audience,” said Carl Richell, CEO, System76. “By bringing together our engineering, marketing, and customer support, System76 with HP are introducing HP Dev One to combine powerful hardware with optimized Pop!_OS for the app dev community.”

“Software developers are looking for a device that is customized and optimized for the way they code,” said Tylitha Stewart, Vice President and Global Head of Consumer Services and Subscriptions, HP Inc. “By working with System76, we are meeting this need and providing a premium experience with Linux Pop!_OS preinstalled to deliver the new HP Dev One. The device has features important to developers including an optional Linux keyboard tuned with a super key and designed to be more efficient at the core.”

As a reminder, some of the core specs of the laptop are as follows:
- Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U, 8 cores, 16 threads, 1.9-4.4 GHz
- 16 GB DDR4 @ 3,200 MHz
- 1 TB PCIe NVMe M.2 2280, transfer speed of 3 GB/s
- 14" 1080p screen, 1,000 nits
- 2 USB C ports
- HDMI port
- 2 USB ports
- headphone jack
- 53 Wh battery
- 720p webcam
- 3.24 lb

Prices start at **$1,099.** If you want you can add the Launch keyboard by System76 and a mouse as additional accessories.

I should be getting a review unit soon, so stay tuned for that!
