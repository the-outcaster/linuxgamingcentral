While it was already big news that [*HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/523660/HYPERCHARGE_Unboxed/) (first/third-person shooter with toy soldiers) got a [Linux port](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/523660/view/3103549965094202866) last Thursday, what's even better is the in-game servers are now cross-platform between the Windows and Linux clients. Previously, the Linux version did not pick up any servers that were hosted on Windows, but after getting in touch with the developers, I can now confirm the servers work between the two operating systems. You can join a Windows-based server on Linux and vice versa, and I haven't come across any hiccups yet.

Great news indeed! In fact, one of the developers told me on r/linux_gaming that there will even be [cross-platform support with the Nintendo Switch version later down the road](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/ttvfy8/comment/i30cc94/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I was given a review key of the game and will have a review here soon. In the meantime, you can pick up the game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/523660/HYPERCHARGE_Unboxed/) for $20.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
