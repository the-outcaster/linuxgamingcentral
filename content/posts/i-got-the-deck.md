While Valve might have given me the middle finger by never giving me a review unit of the Steam Deck, I'm now happy to report the one that I pre-ordered had finally shown up at my door this morning.

So what does this mean for LGC? Well, I've got the following articles planned, in no particular order (I may also not do them if I lose interest):
- a full review. I heavily debated on this one. Yes, there are hundreds of reviews out there already. But nothing wrong with being the 101st review...right?!
- a guide on emulating Nintendo Switch games on Deck. Although I'm a little hesitant about this one, you guys know how stringent Nintendo is on crap like that...
- any game review that I do will also touch on how well it plays on Deck
- something else I'm probably forgetting

I'll also be experimenting with my YouTube channel and uploading a few videos there. Such as commentating on how *Metroid Prime Trilogy* fares on the handheld, as well as *Smash Bros.* If there's anything else you guys want me to cover, I'm all ears. In the meantime, I think I'm going to celebrate the arrival of my Deck with a few cocktails.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
