It's been a few months since the last [1.9.0 update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/infinitime_1.9.0_released/) for the InfiniTime firmware for the PineTime. Version 1.10.0 mostly has under the hood changes, which are "very important for the maintenance of the project," but there are still some goodies here for you and I to enjoy. Here's some of the new features:
- Timer app has a re-designed UI to make the buttons easier to press. You can also hold the buttons down to quickly change the value
- notifications can now be dismissed by right-swiping the screen
- you can now record GIFs with InfiniSim
- sleep time is now faster
- improved colors on the LCD

There's also been a few bug fixes, including the track progress now correctly being displayed in the Music app and the alarm should now always ring.

Check the full patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime/releases/tag/1.10.0).
