InfiniTime -- one of the many firmwares available for Pine64's PineTime smartwatch -- 1.11, codenamed "Red Nectarine," adds support for external resources, while adding two new watch faces. In regards to the former, this allows the developers to store "heavy data," such as fonts and images, into the external flash memory. This frees up more resources to the main memory of the watch.

As a result of this move, this makes adding support for new watch faces and apps easier. So to coincide with this release, we've also got the Infineat and G7710 watch faces, which you can see in the cover photo. The latter is apparently inspired by "a well-known LCD watch."

Besides this, there are plenty of additions, improvements, and fixes:
- backlight brightness is now limited when the flashlight is off
- pink color added for PinetimeStyle watch face; this watch face can now also make the step count display configurable
- reorganized documentation
- code cleanup
- sleep mode added
- improved status icon visibility
- *plenty* of other changes

Full patch notes can be seen on [GitHub](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime/releases/tag/1.11.0). Upgrading your PineTime's firmware is the same as it was before, but to add support for the new watch faces, you'll need to install a new resource package. Instructions are provided in the release notes.
