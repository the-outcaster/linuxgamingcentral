The [PineTime](https://boilingsteam.com/primed-for-pinetime/) is a smartwatch powered by open-source firmware. One such popular firmware to run on the PineTime is [InfiniTime](https://infinitime.io/).

This weekend, InfiniTime received a decently-sized update, codenamed ["Limeberry"](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime/releases/tag/1.9.0). This update includes a new terminal-themed watchface, the ability to turn Bluetooth on or off with the flip of a switch, improved notifications, improved heartrate measurements, an improved alarm clock, a few bug fixes, and a few other features. In addition, code has been cleaned up and integration with the [InfiniSim](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniSim) simulator has been improved.

I definitely do like the new watchface. I have all the info I want at a glance. I can see -- in addition to the time -- the date, the battery percentage, how many steps I've taken (when the Bluetooth actually works), heartrate, and whether the watch is successfully connected to a Bluetooth device. The ability to switch Bluetooth on or off is also a welcome addition, as disabling it can preserve the PineTime's battery.

Full patch notes are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime/releases/tag/1.9.0).
