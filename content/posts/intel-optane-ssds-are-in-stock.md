A few weeks ago I had talked about [Intel's Optane SSD](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/intel-optane-905p-ssd-first-impressions/) (the 905p in particular). It's a ridiculously fast SSD -- perfect for reducing the loading time in your games (twice as fast than traditional PCIe NVMe x4 in some cases). Both the 905p and P1600X are back in stock on Newegg:

- 905p, 960 GB, [$399.99](https://www.newegg.com/intel-optane-ssd-905p-series-960gb/p/N82E16820167463?Item=N82E16820167463) (these use a U.2 connection, you'll need to use the included M.2 adapter if your power supply doesn't have the necessary connector type)

If you're looking for something a little less expensive (P1600X uses M.2):
- P1600X, 118 GB, [$75.99](https://www.newegg.com/intel-optane-ssd-p1600x-118gb/p/1Z4-009F-00621)
- P1600X, 58 GB, [$39.99](https://www.newegg.com/intel-optane-ssd-p1600x-58gb/p/20-167-488)

Might be worth picking one up before they sell out! (Again, Intel isn't sponsoring me.) And stay tuned for a review soon.
