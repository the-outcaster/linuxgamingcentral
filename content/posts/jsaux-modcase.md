So JSAUX had been concocting an idea after [another company stole their idea of having an RGB dock](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/jsaux-cancels-current-steam-deck-dock-with-rgb-after-competitor-pinched-it/). Well, today they've unveiled what exactly they've been working on -- the ModCase.

It's a modular case that seems to be similar to what the Project Killswitch and the [DeckMate](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/deckmate-review/) were offering -- the ability to customize what you want to accessorize on your Steam Deck.

Price starts at $30 as the basic set with the front and back cover, a bracket that acts like a kickstand, and a strap that looks very similar to a watch. Parts can be added, going all the way up to the ultimate kit, which would be $140. The ultimate kit includes a cooler, a hub, power bank kit, and a M.2 slot kit.

A really neat addition is the cooler kit, which can lower the Deck's temperature "by up to 18° C" (64° F). The hub supports 4K @ 120Hz, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, 100W PD charging, two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, full-size SD card slot, headphone jack, and Gigabit Ethernet.

Pre-orders start [today](https://jsaux.com/products/modcase-for-steam-deck-pc0104). Orders are expected to be shipped before January 6th or the 20th, depending on what you order with the kit. Should be getting a sample after the holidays, so stay tuned for a review.
