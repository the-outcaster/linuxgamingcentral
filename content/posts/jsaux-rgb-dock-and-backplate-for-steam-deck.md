Today JSAUX -- probably one of the most prolific manufacturers when it comes to Steam Deck accessories -- announced the RGB docking station and backplate for the Deck.

Just look at the pictures. It's freaking *gorgeous*. Need I explain more?

The docking station comes in two varients. Both have a USB 2.0 port, two USB 3.0 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, a HDMI port, and three USB-C ports (one for PD, another for in, the third for 3.0). The upgraded varient also has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a TF card slot, a SD card slot, and a DisplayPort 1.4 port. It also supports 4K@120Hz.

The docking station has six different lighting modes to choose from:
- direct
- breathing
- rainbow wave
- spectrum cycle
- race cycle
- stacking

You can use OpenRGB to customize the colors.

In addition to the docking station, JSAUX is also offering a trasparent version of the Steam Deck backplate with RGBs. It has its own battery, light switch, and it can stay charged via a dedicated USB-C port. Color patterns are as follows:
- color shift
- color marquee
- red/blue/green/purple breathing
