Version [5.25](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.25.0/) of the excellent KDE Plasma desktop has shipped today. It probably won't be long before SteamOS on the Deck gets this update. A brief overview of what's new with this release would be:
- an overview effect, which shows all of your open windows and virtual desktops
- apps, browser tabs, and documents can all be searched with KRunner and the Application Launcher
- virtual desktops can be added, removed, or renamed
- new touchpad gestures to open the Overview, switch between virtual desktops, present windows, or activate the Desktop Grid
- new touchscreen gestures that offer similar functions as the touchpad
- dynamic theming based on the colors of your desktop background
- automatic switching between touch mode and desktop mode depending on if a keyboard is attached. Icons on the desktop become larger when in touch mode, making navigation across the desktop easier
- new customization effects, such as floating panels and blend effects, and shaking the screen when an incorrect password has been entered when logging in
- redesigned Application page for Discover
- easier to manage window manager scripts thanks to a rewrite of the KWin scripts settings page
- Plasma panels can be navigated with a keyboard

The touch mode in particular will definitely come in handy for the Steam Deck.
