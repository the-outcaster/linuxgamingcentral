If you happen to own the AMD varient of the [OneXPlayer Mini](https://onexplayer.eu/onexplayer-mini/), you may have wanted to be able to control the fan. Well, that's now a reality thanks to this [driver](https://gitlab.com/Samsagax/oxp-platform-dkms/). Building, installing, and usage instructions are provided.

Note that this will *not* work on the Intel version until the developer gets "the correct EC registers to read/write to."

Special thanks to **Samsagax** from the ChimeraOS team for this driver. He keeps denying that he isn't a programmer, but he *definitely* is.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
