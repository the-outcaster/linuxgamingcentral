The demo for *Kirby and the Forgotten Land* was released on the Nintendo eShop a day less than a week ago. Pretty good game if I say so myself, albeit for the somewhat unsettling Mouthful mode. I dumped the demo and put it on my desktop, and, of course, it runs day one on [Ryujinx](https://ryujinx.org), the Switch emulator. Lots of stuttering (that's the shaders getting cached), but after the shaders have been cached it runs decently. [It even runs on AMD](https://twitter.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1499516783014854665) with the Vulkan PR.

Unfortunately, even with vsync off, the framerate won't go past 30 FPS. I'm really hoping someone comes up with a 60 FPS patch when the full game comes out. But in the meantime, you can run the demo at higher resolutions than 1080p, thanks to Switch emulators. And who knows -- I might have a review on it here if you guys would be okay with that.
