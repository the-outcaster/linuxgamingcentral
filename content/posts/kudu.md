Oh yeah kid, a new (refurbished) [laptop](https://system76.com/laptops/kudu) in all it's glory. Here's some photos:

Comes with a Ryzen 9 5900X, a RTX 3060, 16 GB DDR4 RAM clocked at 3,200 MHz, and 500 GB of PCIe Gen 3 storage. Full review, including benchmarks, will be on Boiling Steam. Reason for this is, LGC is too new to be asking for hardware review units at this point; when I asked for this unit I was writing for BS at the time. Once LGC has become a little more well-established within the community, then I can start doing some bigger things here.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
