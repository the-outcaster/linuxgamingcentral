Got quite a few new things going on at LGC, so let's get started.

# Logo Added to the Top
I got the logo added to the top of the page. Doesn't look great on the left, I know, but I'm hoping to get it centered once I figure it out. Still better than just text I would argue.

# Updated Plausible Analytics
I have updated the [Plausible Analytics](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/plausible_analytics_added/) to bypass ad-blockers. The Brave web browser still blocks the analytics, to my testing and to my knowledge. So use that if you don't want LGC to track where you're going. Again, forking the source code for the site is also possible.

# RSS Updated
Previously you could read an entire article from your RSS feed. Unfortunately I've had to keep the feed to just the summary. This is to combat against content scrapers (those copy-pasta websites that post *my own content* without even giving me credit). Depending on what RSS reader you use, you should still be able to read the entirety of the post by clicking on "Complete Story."

# Recommendations Page Updated
The [Recommendations](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/recommendations/) page has been updated to include FOSS and native Steam titles, in addition to recommended content creators. This list will obviously continue to get updated over time with more games, content creators, etc.

**TL;DR**:
- logo added to the top of the site
- analytics now bypass ad-blockers; use Brave if you're paranoid
- RSS feed has been updated to just the summary of a post rather than the full post
- Recommendations page has been updated to include FOSS/native Linux games

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
