Here's the logo, courtesy of a Fiverr artist by the name of *bykai2*:
![lgc logo](/images/logo/logo.webp)
Eventually I'll figure out how to put it directly on the top of the page...yeah, I'm a bit rusty when it comes to web development, but at least you can see the updated favicon, rather than the ordinary, square red icon on your tab from before. It's also there on my Twitter account and the Matrix room.

Speaking of Matrix, you should be able to join the newly created LGC channel here: [`#linux-gaming-central:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#linux-gaming-central:matrix.org). I recommend using [Element](https://element.io) as the Matrix frontend. Note that if you prefer to use Discord, you should be able to bridge the Matrix channel by following [this guide](https://boilingsteam.com/how-to-bridge-discord-in-matrix/) from Boiling Steam.

Drop by and say hello! And let me know your thoughts regarding the logo.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
