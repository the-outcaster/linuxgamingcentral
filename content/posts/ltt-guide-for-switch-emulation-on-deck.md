Whelp, looks like LTT beat me to the Switch emulation guide I was planning on doing. But that's not the point of this post. Content creators -- and small ones, at that -- have had their videos ripped off their channel from the DMCA-hungry lawyers at Nintendo just for showing off gameplay footage of Switch games being emulated on the Deck. Well, Anthony from LTT decided to take matters into his own hands, braced himself, and put up a *full* [guide](https://youtu.be/oIYvPNtWZ34) on how to emulate Switch games on Deck (mind you, he's doing it through a completely legal means). He was even bold enough to set the title of the video as "Take down this video, Nintendo. I dare you." It's currently #22 for trending gaming videos (it was #24 just a few minutes ago).

The video was put up today, but I'm honestly surprised Nintendo hasn't taken his word and taken their hammers out yet. I suspect it has to do with the fact that the game footage was blurred (Anthony even explains why the screens were blurred). Even so, the clock is ticking. By tomorrow morning, I'm placing my bets and expect the video to be down, especially for how well-known LTT is.

I actually have to commend LTT for being brave enough to do this, and even more so for the audacious title. The video even breaks down why people should do this, and offers an explanation on legality vs. piracy (of course, LTT says what they did was perfectly legal). I have the video downloaded already and will be more than happy to share it once the YouTube version is down (I will even go so far as to cut off the sponsor segments, just for you guys).
