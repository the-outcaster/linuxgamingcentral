It's been over five months since the last stable update to Lutris -- a convenient game launcher and manager. The wait has been worth it though, as we've got quite a lot of interesting new features with this update.

First, **Proton is now supported.** [GE-Proton](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/tags/ge-proton/) is used by default. But keep in mind "it is still recommended to stick with the builds provided by Lutris."

**Users with "very large libraries" will be seeing performance improvements and a more responsive UI**, with "loads of other UI improvements!"

ModDB links can be referenced in Lutris installers, and Lutris also has integration with Itch.io.

Some other features:
- drag n' drop support on the main window
- "missing" sidebar option added
- refreshed UI for several windows
- banners and cover art now shows platform badges
- game count now displayed in search bar
- Battle.NET integration
- improved detection of DOSBox games on GOG
- several other minor improvements

See the full patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases/tag/v0.5.13).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
