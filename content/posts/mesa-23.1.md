Mesa [23.1](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/tags/mesa-23.1.0) was released 12 hours ago. While the patch notes haven't been posted yet, we can get a glimpse of what's new with this massive update thanks to the article from [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-23.1-Released):
- [faster game loading times and less in-game stutter](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/shader-compilation-improved-with-mesa-23.1/)
- [smaller shader cache](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-getting-smaller-shader-cache/) -- as much as 60% in some cases!
- RadeonSI Rusticl OpenCL support
- support for AMD's GFX940
- improvements to Zink
- initial support for Intel Meteor Lake
- initial LoongArch CPU support
- Intel Vulkan video support
- a *ton* of other features

Arch users will likely get this update almost immediately. Fedora users may have to wait a while. And hopefully SteamOS 3.5 will get this upgrade soon, as Steam Deck users will especially benefit from this.
