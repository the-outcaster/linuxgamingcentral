New bundle by Humble Bundle is out: [Must-Play Metroidvanias](https://www.humblebundle.com/games/must-play-metroidvania). As you might have guessed from the name, this bundle is all about Metroidvanias.

The bundle -- at $15 or more -- comes with seven games:
- [*Hollow Knight*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/)
- [*Rain World*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/Rain_World/)
- [*Blasphemous*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/774361/Blasphemous/)
- [*Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/692850/Bloodstained_Ritual_of_the_Night/)
- [*Lost Ruins*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1306630/Lost_Ruins/)
- [*Lone Fungus*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674780/Lone_Fungus/)
- [*Haiku, the Robot*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1231880/Haiku_the_Robot/)

You'll also get two coupons:
- 50% off [*Zapling Bygone*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1489110/Zapling_Bygone/)
- 20% off [*Rain World: Downpour*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1933390/Rain_World_Downpour/)

All keys are redeemed on Steam, and *Hollow Knight*, *Lost Ruins*, and *Blasphemous* are available natively on Linux.

Seems like a pretty decent bundle if, like me, you're into Metroidvanias. Offer ends in three weeks!

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
