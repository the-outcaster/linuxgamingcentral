A shipping manifest of the ROG Ally seems to have been [leaked](https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-gaming-console-to-feature-amd-ryzen-7-7840u-zen4-rdna3-apu) while it was shipping between headquarters. From the looks of it, the Ally will be using the **7840U with Radeon 780M graphics,** (Zen 4, RDNA 3) with 8 cores, 16 threads, and a base clock speed of 3.3 GHz, max of 5 GHz. The 780M iGPU is said to have performance similar to the GTX 1650. ASUS did mention the APU is custom though; it's probably a lower-powered version to keep the battery life sane. According to a [leaked image](https://twitter.com/9550pro/status/1648349687454535680), it appears the custom Phoenix APU is codenamed "Z1 Extreme". 

Similar to the Deck, the leaked image mentions the Ally will have **16 GB LPDDR5 RAM**. It will also support USH-II MicroSD cards, and come with a **M.2 2230 512 GB PCIe Gen 4** drive. ASUS [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ASUS_ROG/status/1646808011355336705) a few days ago that the Ally "is set to release **worldwide** (and it may be sooner than you expect)." VideoCardz suggests that the release could be later this quarter.

Rumors suggest the price of the handheld will be somewhere between **$650-700**, though don't ask me from where I got those details -- I'm just reading the article from [Games Revealed](https://www.gamesrevealed.com/asus-rog-ally-specs-leak-under-700/).

The [GPD Win Mini](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/rog-ally-gets-competitor/) might have a few tricks up its own sleeves though, including an open standard for connecting eGPUs and a similar price point.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
