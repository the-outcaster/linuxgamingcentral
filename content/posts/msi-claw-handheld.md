The baby boom of PC gaming handhelds continue. Now MSI enters the competition. Aside from using Intel's Meteor Lake graphics and being black in color, to me it seems pretty much like a ROG Ally clone.

Codenamed the Claw A1M, it comes with the following:
- RGB sticks (they don't seem to be hall-effect from what I'm reading though)
- RGB ABXY buttons
- Windows 11 Home
- Intel Core Ultra 7 155H
- 7" 1080p touchscreen at 120 Hz, 500 nits, 100% sRGB
- Wi-Fi 7/Bluetooth 5.4
- 16 GB LPDDR5-6400
- hall effect analog triggers
- 53 Wh battery
- 1 TB SSD
- Thunderbolt 4 support

Rumor of the mill suggests it will come at a starting price of $700 (at least, that's what [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/MSI-Claw-A1M) says). No word yet on when it will release.

Speaking of Phoronix, Michael recently did a [benchmark](https://www.phoronix.com/review/z1-extreme-meteorlake) comparing the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H with the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme. In some tests, such as with GravityMark, the 155H did better than the Z1 Extreme. In other cases the Z1 Extreme outperformed the 155H.

Still, I really don't see the Claw A1M offering much of a competitive advantage over other mainstream handhelds. The [Legion Go](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/legion-go-tools-for-linux/) has a much bigger screen size, detachable joycons, a FPS mode, a kickstand, and a higher resolution and refresh rate. And I can already see the ChimeraOS developers cringing, because they're now going to have to support yet *another* handheld.

See more details on [MSI's website](https://www.msi.com/Handheld/Claw-A1MX/Overview).

In other news, [kernel 6.7](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/kernel-6.7/) just declared Meteor Lake graphics as stable.
