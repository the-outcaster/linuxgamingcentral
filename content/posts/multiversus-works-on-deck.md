While it's debatable whether [*MultiVersus*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/) will be a *Smash* killer, I'm happy to report the game now runs *flawlessly* on the Steam Deck. Previously, running the game was technically possible, but you would get kicked almost immediately if you joined an online match, due to EAC. Evidently, Warner Bros. listened to [community feedback](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1818750/discussions/0/3275817873360187869/); after testing today's open beta, I can confirm the kicking is no longer a thing. The game also has 16:10 support. I might even go so far as to give it the unofficial "Steam Deck Verified" status!

On my desktop I can confirm the game works on Arch, although for some reason it won't pick up my PS5 controller.

I put out a [gameplay video](https://youtu.be/c_efhYumyso). You'll have to forgive me for the bad lighting, and also for the uncomfortable way I was holding the Deck; the tripod was right in front of my face. I'll figure out a better way to record next time I do something like this.

*MultiVersus* should be out of beta later this year. Now that I can properly play it to its' full capacity, I'll probably have some initial impressions next week.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
