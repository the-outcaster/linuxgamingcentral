Here are my top games that were released in 2022. Please note:
1. These picks arenâ€™t sorted in any particular order.
2. Obviously, my opinion on these is subjective. Your favorites will likely differ from mine.
3. Some games may have previously been released on other platforms/stores *prior* to 2022, but migrated to Steam in said year, so those games are included here.

# [The Entropy Centre](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-entropy-centre-review/)
Great game to play if you're a fan of the *Portal* series. Instead of using portals, however, the main protagonist uses a talking gun named ASTRA to help reverse time. Reversing time can move cubes back to their original position and help Aria get one step closer to her goal -- that of saving the earth from total destruction.

# [Sonic Frontiers](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/sonic-frontiers-review/)
Heh, this one should be kind of obvious with the amount of coverage I've posted regarding this game. I'm glad to finally see a more mature take on the series, an open-world, and to see a game that Sega didn't screw up for once.

By the way, if you're looking to add mods to the game, I have guides for [desktop](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/sonic-frontiers-modding-guide/) and [Steam Deck](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/updated-sonic-frontiers-steam-deck-modding-guide/).

# [Kena: Bridge of Spirits](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review/)
The game was technically first released on the Epic Games Store in 2021, but re-released to Steam in September 2022, so I'm counting it here. It's one of those games where, despite its cute outer charm, lies combat that is *Souls*-like in difficulty. Amazing animation quality. Beautiful soundtrack. Need I say more?

# [Frontier Hunter: Erza's Wheel of Fortune](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/frontier-hunter-review/)
An early access Metroidvania that's showing some seriously good potential. Three different characters to choose from, each with their own unique fighting style. Characters have special moves and they can cast magic. Almost makes it feel like it's a fighting game, with challenging boss fights in the mix.

You might want to stay away if you're not into anime, however (I'm not into anime myself but it's still a good game regardless).

# [Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Reunion](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/crisis-core-remake-on-deck-report/)
Though some have argued that this is a "cheaply made" remake, in all honestly that's okay with me. This game didn't really need to get expanded upon like *Final Fantasy VII* did. The game was already great back when it was on the PSP 15 years ago, and it was made even better with skippable cutscenes, better graphics, and better battle mechanics, while retaining most of the original...*core*.

Only caveat that I don't like is most of the original voice actors were replaced with new ones. There is, however, a [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/crisiscoreff7reunion/mods/15) that restores the original voice actors.

# [TUNIC](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/tunic_review/)
Behind the adorable fox is a game that's going to seriously challenge your every wit to survive. If you're a fan of the *Zelda* series, particularly the top-down/isometric games, you'll probably like this too, as long as you're okay with the *Souls*-like difficulty and having to rely on the in-game guide to help get yourself around.

# [Sackboy: A Big Adventure](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/sackboy-optimization-guide/)
Perhaps this is a bit of a controversial opinion, but it's nice to actually have a game that *isn't* violent. *Sackboy* fits the bill quite nicely. It's basically the *Super Mario Galaxy* fix for PC. A game where you can unwind and do some 3D platforming. The music is pretty decent too.

# [MultiVersus](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/multiversus-works-on-deck/)
Basically your *Smash Bros.* equivalent with Warner Bros. characters. Although, of course, some of the mechanics are a little different.

# [Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1378990/Crash_Bandicoot_4_Its_About_Time/)
Another one of those games that was previously released in 2021 on Battle.NET, but migrated over to Steam in October of 2022. Kind of similar to *Sackboy* in its playstyle.

# [Gotham Knights](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1496790/Gotham_Knights/)
Not much to say about this one...it's open-world and it's fun. Batman has died and his comrades are making sure Gotham City stays under control. I guess it plays similarly to *Mad Max*, but I never played that game.

# [Ex-Zodiac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1249480/ExZodiac/)
If you were craving a *Star Fox* fix, you don't need to look any further. Turn the max FPS to 15 FPS and you get even more nostalgia. You might as well throw in a CRT monitor and a SNES-style controller to boot. Bonus: it's native to Linux.
