After weeks of rumors on [r/AllStarBrawl](https://www.reddit.com/r/AllStarBrawl/), it does finally appear that a sequel to *Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl* is in the works and will release later this year.

According to the [tweet](https://twitter.com/NickBrawlGame/status/1684557195264884741) by the official Nick Brawl account, NASB 2 will have a campaign mode, "all-new gameplay," new modes, new characters, new content, voiceovers, and crossplay. Looks like Squidward and Jimmy Neutron will make an appearance in this one.

I'm cautiously optimistic about this one. I just hope it doesn't fall flat on its face [like its predecessor did](https://twitter.com/NickBrawlGame/status/1684557195264884741). As for "all-new gameplay," not much was revealed about it for the time being. Whether characters will actually have four specials instead of three, or whether each character will have a grab/throw that's different than the other, we don't know.

See the [official website](https://nickelodeonallstarbrawl.com/) for more details, and see the trailer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2nESlbg9GU). *Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2* is set to release on Steam in the Fall.
