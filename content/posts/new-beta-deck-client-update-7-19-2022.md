New beta Deck client shipped out just a few hours ago. This adds the Sucheng keyboard for Tradional Chinese, adds an Achievements page to the Steam overlay, prevents the annoying "You have unclaimed digital rewards!" notification from appearing every time you turn the Deck on, fixes Night Mode from automatically turning on when it's set to OFF, and brings improvements to the OSK when in desktop mode (should now properly show up or disappear when the appropriate button is pressed). Patch notes are available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/6272968438254558051).

In addition to this, the stable branch of SteamOS has been [updated](https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1549503107129782272) "with a hotfix to enable compatibility with future system and input firmware." This is a backend update and has no user-visible changes.

Also, a friendly reminder to keep your Deck's temperature between 0-35째 C (32-95째 F) in the midst of this heatwave most of us are in. The official Twitter account for the Steam Deck [mentions](https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1549467955754217473) that "if the temperature gets higher than this, Steam Deck may start to throttle performance to protect itself." If the APU reaches 105째 C (221째 F) the Deck will shut down to protect itself (and yourself) from damage. So stay cool this summer!

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
