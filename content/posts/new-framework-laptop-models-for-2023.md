# Framework Laptop 13
The modular laptop by Framework gets an upgrade for 2023. The Framework Laptop 13 now comes with a 13th-Gen Intel processor (i5-1340P, i7-1360P, and i7-1370P). Additionally, for the first time, Framework adds an AMD varient of their laptop. It will sport the Ryzen 7040 series APU (Ryzen 5 or 7) and will come with upgraded RAM -- DDR5 over DDR4 with the Intel laptops. Definitely a big plus in my book that they're now supporting AMD.

The 2023 laptops also come with "refinements," including a "higher capacity battery, matte display, louder speakers, and more rigid hinges." The battery is now 61 Wh and "achieves 11% greater capacity" than previous generations. The matte top layer "lets you work better in a wide range of lighting conditions."

First shipments are in May. **Pre-built laptops start at $1049, DIY editions are $849.** DIY versions also now allow you to choose bezel color and keyboard. Upgraded modules are compatible with existing Framework laptops.

According to their press kit, Fedora 38 and Ubuntu 22.04 "will work fantastically out of the box" for both the Intel and AMD laptops. Manjaro XFCE 22 and Linux Mint 21.1 are reported as "working great."

# Cooler Master Mainboard Case
The Cooler Master mainboard case is a "small form factor case that can turn a Framework laptop mainboard into a minimal PC." It includes a stand and VESA mount. Available in the Spring for **$40.**

# Framework Laptop 16
The Framework Laptop 16 carries much of the same blood as the 13-series laptops, including modularity. Except this time, the screen is 16" and adds two new module systems: input deck and graphics.

Basically, the input customization allows you to reconfigure the keyboard, with up to three sizes -- small, medium, and large. Small is your basic meat and potatoes, medium adds a numpad, secondary display, and macro pads. Large modules will have "both regular backlit keyboards in a range of languages and an RBG backlit version."

**The expansion bay system will allow the user to add an external GPU.** Not only this, but other modules besides GPUs can be used, including a "dual M.2 SSD card."
