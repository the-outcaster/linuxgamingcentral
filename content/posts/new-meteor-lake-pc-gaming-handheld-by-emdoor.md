Normally, when a new PC gaming handheld is announced, it's powered by an AMD processor. Not so much the case with the Emdoor EM-GP080MTL. A company that specializes in making rugged devices for industrial use, they've now entered the handheld gaming market with their new device that sports Intel's latest family of CPUs: Meteor Lake-H. Capable of 20-35 W, the processor also integrates Arc graphics 5.

The resolution of the device will be 1920 x 1200 at 16:10. The screen itself will be 8 inches. Up to 32 GB of LPDDR5X of RAM is supported, and a full 2280 PCIe NVMe drive can be put in, up to 2 TB. No word yet as far as when the device will be available or what it will be priced at.

Meteor Lake, paired with XeSS, seems to provide a ["perfectly playable"](https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-meteor-lake-igpu-gaming-performance/) experience without a discrete GPU. Notebook Italia had a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me99hqwGfpY) showcasing the handheld, but unfortunately it looks like they quickly marked the video as private, as it can no longer be played. PC Gamer [noted](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-first-intel-meteor-lake-handheld-gaming-pc-breaks-cover-as-does-the-most-nintendo-ds-pc-you-will-ever-see/) the video was running *God of War* and mentioned "Meteor Lake is ready to give AMD a run for its money."

I've been keeping tabs with how far Intel has been pushing updates to their Arc GPUs. Seems like with every kernel or Mesa update is some kind of performance improvement with Intel's graphics drivers. So, I'm actually sort of curious to see how this Emdoor handheld will keep up with the competition.
