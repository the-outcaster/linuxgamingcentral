There's been a few PS4 emulators that have been worked on. Well, a new one has entered the fray, and this is coming from the developers who worked on the PS3 emulator RPCS3. The project's name is **RPCSX** and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RPCSX/rpcsx). Per the description from the README:
> This is an experimental emulator for PS4 (PlayStation 4) written in C++ for Linux. It's NOT possible to run any games yet. It's also unknown when it will become possible.

Interesting that it mentions "for Linux." Nice. I guess Windows users are going to have to wait to get it to run on their system.

Per the dev interview with [Read Only Memo](https://www.readonlymemo.com/p/ps4-emulator-rpcsx-dolphin-hdr-ntsc-pal-colors), the benefit of having this emulator will manifest itself when you'll still be able to play a game that might get removed from PlayStation Network. There's no ETA because "every team member has work/family/hobbies and it is not full-time work." Currently DH, kd-11, and Nekotekina are working on it.

There aren't even instructions on how to build the emulator right now. But, seeing the amazing progress that was done to RPCS3, I imagine it won't take long to get some homebrew games running at least. Then again, I could be wrong on that since the PS4 is using a completely different architecture than its predecessor.
