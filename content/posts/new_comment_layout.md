The beauty of having LGC open-source is someone has already created a [pull request](https://github.com/linuxgamingcentral/website/pull/2) to fix the commenting situation. Previously, comments were universal; they could be read across every post. Thanks to Gabriele Musco (who I assume is also GabMus from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/t9hfzw/comment/hzub60n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), this is no longer the case. Comments will be individual to each post. 

The downside here though, is the comments that were previously posted are now gone. Don't worry though, I have taken a screenshot of the comments so I can keep the wonderful feedback you guys had. And don't be afraid to make a PR for the site in case you want to enhance it in some way.

If someone would be kind enough to leave a comment here or on a different post, just so I can verify that GabMus' solution has worked. Could be as simple as adding "_" to the comment field and posting that. Thanks!

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
