Steve from TronicsFix released a video less than two weeks ago where he tore down three new DualSense controllers from Sony. The newer models -- the pink, purple, and light blue -- seemed to have a slightly different motherboard layout. But what he found out as he was taking it apart was the analog sticks could potentially be upgraded. 

The potentiometer is the same color all around -- before, there was one side where the color was different. Whether this means the sticks got upgraded or not remains a mystery, if it did hopefully it has addressed some of the stick drift concerns.

But one thing that was definitely different were the springs for the triggers. I have an original DualSense controller, and often the right trigger will lose tension because the clip falls out. Well, the good news here is, the clips got an upgrade. They're thicker. Which probably means they have a better grip in the slots by the triggers. Now you can aggressively press the trigger and not worry about it losing tension.

Other than that it seems just about it for these new controllers. Just thought I'd mention it though for those of you who are looking to get a new game controller. The DualSense works great on Linux, by the way; Sony even wrote their own driver for the device and it has been incorporated in the kernel since 5.12.

Also, here's a shameless plug for my [DualSense LED app](https://github.com/cow-killer/dualsense-led-configurator), which allows you to customize the LEDs.
