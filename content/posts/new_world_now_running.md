[*New World*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World/) is a pretty massive hit. On [Steam Charts](https://steamcharts.com/app/1063730), the game has recorded an all-time high of 913,027 players. Almost 18k have played as of the past hour.

For a while, the game couldn't run on Linux through Proton due to the EAC it had. But it seems like [that's no longer the case](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/u1slsh/new_world_finally_working_on_linux/). YouTuber CTRL ALT REBOOT got some [footage](https://youtu.be/2qvkHQLGfaA) of the game running on Linux Mint.

The Reddit post mentions "after *Apex Legends* was patched for EAC on Linux, it seems that now *New World* got the same treatment," and noted that the game runs "fairly well" with some stuttering here and there (probably shaders getting compiled). Welp, I guess we can add a couple thousand more players to the game, thanks to *New World* being compatibile with Proton.
