Looks like we're starting off a pretty strong week. Two titles have either received a Linux version or will be in the near future, and two titles have received Steam Deck support. *Psychonauts 2* [should be releasing on Linux](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/news-for-may-14-20/) later this week too if everything goes according to plan.

*Swordbreaker: Origins* [now has a native Linux version](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1080700/view/3183494090259365692), and along with the update came a few fixes. *Casebook 1899* is an upcoming point-and-click mystery adventure; [the demo will come on May 31 with native Linux support](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1841190/announcements/detail/3208263888232290671). The full game will have Linux support as well.

As for Steam Deck support, *Growbot* already has native Linux support, but in Friday's [update](https://steamcommunity.com/games/661680/announcements/detail/3189121526235204042), the game is more optimized for the Steam Deck's controls. *Serious Sam 4* also received [Steam Deck support](https://steamcommunity.com/games/257420/announcements/detail/3197004889168309250), although the game is run through Proton.

I guess the Steam Deck really has kicked off getting more and more developers on board with supporting it, [just like James Ramey, president of CodeWeavers had predicted](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/interview-with-james-ramey-from-codeweavers/)!
