Just posted today, *Days Gone* is now [Steam Deck Verified](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1259420/view/3209388999176341939). All the post shows is a screenshot with the green checkmark with all the requirements met, including full control functionality, Deck pad icons, legible text, and a decent default graphics configuration.

Nonetheless, it's a massively popular title, one that's been published by PlayStation PC LLC. Great to see a hit like this look and feel good on the Deck!
