In much the same move as [*Rocket League* made a few years ago](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/psyonix-is-joining-the-epic-family-/), [*Fall Guys* will become exclusive to the Epic Games Store on the PC platform](https://www.fallguys.com/en-US/news/fall-guys-is-going-free-on-june-21-launching-on-playstation-nintendo-switch-xbox-and-the-epic-games-store) starting June 21. A heads-up that if you want to own and play the game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/), buy it before that date. You'll still be able to use the Steam version after June 21, but you won't be able to buy it from the Steam store anymore.

On the other hand I should note that once *Fall Guys* makes the move, the game will be free-to-play, rather than the $20 it is right now. But you'll get the "Legacy Pack," which has "a nickname, nameplate, the Regal costume, the Veggie Dog costume, the Feisty Dwarf costume â€“ and a Season Pass for Season 1." You make the call.

The game should work with [GE-Proton7-15](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/news-ge-proton7-15-released/) onwards.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
