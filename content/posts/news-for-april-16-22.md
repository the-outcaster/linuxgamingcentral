# General Linux Gaming
- Ubuntu is [falling behind](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ubuntu_bites_the_dust_for_gaming/), but apparently the newly released Ubuntu 22.04 is ["absolutely stunning."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GLhJM8V_2g)
- We're starting to see [less and less](https://boilingsteam.com/protons-recent-push-to-reduce-the-number-of-borked-games/) games that are borked through Proton. Thanks, Valve and CodeWeavers, for all the hard work that you do
- [21 new games have been released on Steam with Linux support](https://boilingsteam.com/new-steam-games-native-linux-2022-04-19/)
- You can update the firmware on your DualSense controller with [Sony's new FW updater app](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/how-to-update-dualsense-firmware-on-linux/). Works great with wine-ge-custom or GE-Proton
- The game *Overgrowth* has now gone [open-source](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/overgrowth-from-wolfire-games-goes-open-source/)

# Steam Deck
- Looks like [*Metroid Prime Trilogy* works very well with the Deck](https://boilingsteam.com/metroid-prime-trilogy-a-great-fit-for-the-steam-deck/)
- You can [customize the theme on Steam](https://boilingsteam.com/the-steam-deck-gets-a-theming-plugin/)
- The Deck was the [Steam top seller](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-was-the-steam-top-seller-for-the-week-ending-april-17/) for the week ending April 17
- Variable refresh rate switching is ["coming soon"](https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1516140319443619842)
- Small [Deck client update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3220645457134651321) went out, adding a few bug fixes and some other features
- The dock, now called a "docking station," has upgraded ports. Rather than having USB 2 ports, these ports have been upgraded to USB 3. Additionally the Ethernet is now Gigabit

# Software Updates
- [Proton 7.0-2](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/news-proton-7.0-2-released/) released, adds tons of new compatible games and almost hundreds of bug fixes
- Proton Experimental has been [updated](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/proton-experimental-updated-fixes-resident-evil-revelations-2-for-steam-deck/) with newly playable titles, improved steering wheel detection, and a few game-specific bug fixes
- [GE-Proton7-15](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/news-ge-proton7-15-released/) released just a day after that enables *Fall Guys* to run and adds video playback to several titles
- [Wine 7.7](https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.7) released with "more progress on the PE conversion of the X11 and OSS drivers," bug fixes, theming support, and more
- ProtonUp-Qt has been updated to [2.6.1](https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/releases/tag/v2.6.1). This adds support for the Flatpak version of the Heroic Games launcher and adds a tool description to install dialog. I have a guide on using ProtonUp-Qt [here](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton_ge_tutorial/)
- Lutris [0.5.10.1](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/lutris-0.5.10.1-available/) improves the Steam Deck experience with better Flatpak support
- A new character has been added to the *Skullgirls* cast: [Umbrella](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/245170/view/3180113060463690523)

# Other
- Not necessarily related to Linux, but let's get a petition going for *Portal 3*. Eric Wolpaw, writer for several of Valve's titles, says ["we should just do it"](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/erik-wolpaw-to-valve-on-portal-3-we-should-just-do-it/)
- The Framework laptop is now [open-source](https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/mainboard-availability-and-open-source-release)
