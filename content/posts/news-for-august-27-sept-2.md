# Steam Deck
- keep your expectations in check when it comes to [Steam Deck Verified](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/flawed-steam-deck-verification-system/)
- when buying a MicroSD card, you should be looking for a [U3 A2 UHS-I](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/microsd-card-buying-tips/)
- new Deck client beta [improves slider controls](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3370402903759152855) and adds some other fixes
- dbrand has revealed the full specs for the [Project Killswitch](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/dbrand-reveal-the-full-details-of-project-killswitch-for-steam-deck/) accessory. Seems pretty similar to the [DeckMate](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/deckmate-review/)

# Native Linux Games
- apparently the developers are done with [*Splitgate*](https://www.splitgate.com/blogs/important-announcement-about-splitgates-future) and are moving on to their next project
- [25 new Linux games on Steam](https://boilingsteam.com/new-steam-games-with-native-linux-clients-2022-08-31-edition/)

# Software Updates
- **Slippi** [2.5.0](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/slippi-2.5.0-released/) adds desync detection and M-EX support. [2.5.1](https://github.com/project-slippi/Ishiiruka/releases/tag/v2.5.1) was released shortly thereafter to address the one-millionth desync detection rate for Animelee users
- **Rare** [1.9.0 RC 1](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/rare-1.9.0-rc-released/) adds tons of bug fixes
- **Wine** [7.16](https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.16) fixes *Saints Row (2022)* and adds plenty of other bug fixes
- **Proton Experimental** [fixes the launcher for *Final Fantasy XIV*](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog) once again
- **Heroic Games Launcher** [2.4.1](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.4.1) adds improvements and general bug fixes. A [hotfix](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.4.2) was later made to fix issues with the Epic login

# Other
- if you happen to own an AMD-based OneXPlayer Mini, you might find this [fan control driver](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/kernel-module-for-onexplayer-now-available/) to be useful
- Boiling Steam [gets a new contributor](https://boilingsteam.com/make-a-game-in-10-minutes-with-godot/)
- Google is [retiring Stadia](https://www.inputmag.com/gaming/google-is-killing-off-stadia-cloud-gaming-peloton-bungie-capcom). Something that I saw from 10 miles away
