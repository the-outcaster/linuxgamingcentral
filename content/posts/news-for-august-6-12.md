# Steam Deck
- I recently compared [Ryujinx against Yuzu](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ryujinx-vs-yuzu-tested-on-deck/). Yuzu won, but take it with a grain of salt as it's using half-resolution
- the [*Portal* skin](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/portal-skin-on-deck-review/) -- it's *amazing*. Raffle is [still going on!](https://twitter.com/linuxgamingctr/status/1556661929694855169)
- the [DeckMate](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/deckmate-review/) is a pretty nice accessory
- new beta Deck client update [fixes stuttering](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steamos-beta-update-8-8-2022/) and [adds keyboard fixes](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-client-beta-update-8-10-2022/). If you're opted into the Preview branch, you'll also get a performance improvement with *Forza Horizon 5*
- we could be seeing an [update to the kernel](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/kernel-update-could-be-coming-to-steamos-soon/) soon
- we've hit [a little over 4.5k verified/playable titles](https://www.protondb.com/), but Hi-Tech Lo-Life has an [interesting take](https://youtu.be/Ekn4jJDmi_g) about this
- *Spider-Man Remastered* [works great on Deck](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/spider-man-remastered-is-awesome-on-steam-deck/)

# Software Updates
- **ChimeraOS** [34](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/chimeraos-34-released/) improves handheld gamepad support along with plenty of bug fixes. Works pretty well on Deck!
- **Heroic Games Launcher** [2.4.0](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/heroic-games-launcher-2.4.0-released/) adds GOG cloud save support and games can be added as non-Steam shortcuts
- **SteamTinkerLaunch** [11](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/stl-v11-released/) adds Flatpak support along with a host of other features and changes
- **Yuzu** finally gets [an easy installer for Linux](https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-linux-installer/), just like with their Windows version
- **Wine** [7.15](https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.15) adds RSA encryption, command lists in Direct2D, and fixes 22 bugs
- **glibc** [2.36-2](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6051) fixes EAC! The previous version [broke it](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/glibc-2.36-breaks-eac/)

# Native Steam Games
- [*SokoChess*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/sokochess-review/) puts an interesting spin on the game of Chess, though I don't recommend playing it on Deck
- [*Justin Wack and the Big Time Hack*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/justin-wack-and-the-big-time-hack-coming-to-linux/) is a point & click adventure coming to Linux on August 23rd
- 33 [new titles](https://boilingsteam.com/new-steam-games-with-native-linux-clients-2022-08-10-edition/) on Steam

# Non-native Games
- [*XEL*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/xel-review/) is an okay *Zelda*-like ARPG, but has quite a few issues that keep it from being enjoyable

# Other
- Discord server [now live](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/discord-added/). I'm looking into bridging it with the Matrix channel
