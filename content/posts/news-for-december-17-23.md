# Steam Deck
- SteamOS 3.4 [shipped to stable](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steamos-3.4-stable/)
- Tuesday's [beta Deck client update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-client-beta-12-19-2022/) adds search tab to controller profile configuration, adds a few additional fixes

- we've hit [7k verified/playable titles](https://boilingsteam.com/7000-games-playable-and-verified-on-the-steam-deck/)
- seems like everyone and their brother sees the Deck as [their hardware of the year](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/my-game-of-the-year-2022-is-the-steam-deck/). I guess you could also say the Deck has finally put the "Year of the Linux Desktop" joke to an end

# Interviews
- did an [interview](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/interview-with-canonical-dev/) with an Ubuntu kernel developer. Highly recommend giving it a read if you haven't already; it's very candid and open

# Hardware
- I did a review on a [GameCube controller](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/phobgcc-review/) that uses an open-source PCB
- PhobGCC [2.0.2](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/phobgcc-2.0.2/) makes FW updating easier and adds a more reliable connection to C-stick
- *Portal with RTX* can supposedly [run on AMD-based systems](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/portal-rtx-playable-on-amd/)

# Software Updates
- **SteamTinkerLaunch** [v12](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steamtinkerlaunch-v12/) is massive, gets tons of Steam Deck improvements and initial support for Hedge Mod Manager
- **ProtonUp-Qt** [2.7.7](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/protonup-qt-2.7.7/) adds two new compatibility tools, and you can check ProtonDB rankings for your games

- **GE-Proton** [7-43](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ge-proton7-43/) fixes audio issues with *Immortals: Fenyx Rising*, enables hairworks on *The Witcher 3* (although from what I've been told hairworks still apparently works without this)
- **Wine** [8.0-rc2](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/wine-8.0-rc2/) fixes 50 bugs, many of which pertain to specific games
- **NVIDIA** [beta Vulkan driver](https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver) adds support for the 4k series cards
