# Steam Deck
- Monday's [Deck client beta](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-client-beta-1-6-2023/) adds up and down arrow keys to the OSK, and pinned notifications for various items
- Thursday's [Deck client beta](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-client-beta-1-19-2023/) fixes non-responsive non-Steam games when the OSK is brought up. **Important: Valve is copy/pasting the patch notes from the desktop client, so not everything in the patch note list for the Deck may be true!**
- Gardiner Bryant says that the Deck needs ["a title that takes full advantage of the...hardware"](https://viewsink.com/steam-deck-64/). I agree; highly recommend giving his article a read
- *The Division 2* gets a [hotfix](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2221490/view/3632750190483497136) that should allow the game to be playable now

# Hardware
- moving from NVIDIA to AMD? [It's been pure bliss](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/moving-from-nvidia-to-amd/)
- want to overclock your AMD GPU? [Here's how](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/increase-power-on-amd-gpus/)
- Aya Neo thinks they can [make a handheld with a dGPU](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/aya-neo-next-2-powered-by-dgpu/). Meanwhile here I am laughing at the fake news
- Gamers Nexus [documents](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/evga-departure-from-the-gpu-business/) EVGA's last video card
- you can now [enable Bluetooth](https://stadia.google.com/controller/) on a Stadia controller
- VR seems to be getting [GameScope support](https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1613605375844012032)

# Native Games
- I wrote down some [quick thoughts](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/fraymakers-quick-thoughts/) regarding the *Smash*-like *Fraymakers* -- it's both good and bad
- I also wrote a review on [*Sonority*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/sonority-review/) -- a puzzle game where you can only progress in the game by playing the right notes on a flute

# Software Updates
- **Wine** [8.0-rc5](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/wine-8.0-rc5/) fixes nine bugs, improves OpenGL perf with *Dark Souls Remastered*. [rc-4](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/wine-8.0-rc4/) fixed 25 bugs and increases rendering speed on external monitors
- **GE-Proton** [7-44](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ge-proton7-44/) adds HDR patches, adds launcher workaround for *Assassin's Creed Brotherhood*. Several releases followed [shortly thereafter](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ge-proton7-46/). **Important: please upgrade to [7-47](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-47) to fix DXVK "invalid state cache files"!**
- **NVIDIA driver** [528.85.05](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/198554/en-us/) gets a few fixes

# Other
- looks like [we won't be getting Wayland support with AppImages](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/appimage-dev-rejects-wayland-support/). To make the situation worse, further responses to the [pull request](https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/pull/540) have caused the thread to be locked and "limited to collaborators"
- GOL does an [interview with the Heroic Games Launcher founder](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/an-interview-with-the-creator-of-the-heroic-games-launcher/)
