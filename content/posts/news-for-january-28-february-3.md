# Steam Deck
- stable client landed on [Wednesday](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-client-stable-update-2-1-2023/), with a list too long to mention here
- Thursday's [beta client update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-client-beta-update-2-2-2023/) remembers virtual keyboard position, adds a few hotkeys for the new BPM
- Ubisoft says [it's up to Valve to support their games](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ubisoft-stance-on-steam-deck-support/)
- want to save some battery life? Here's [some tips](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/preserve-battery-life-on-deck-with-powertools/)
- something needs to get done about the [patching and shader processing times](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-long-pre-loading-and-patching/)
  - apparently we'll be seeing ["big improvement on stuttering problems"](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/amd-gpu-driver-linux-steam-deck-big-improvement-stuttering-problems/) with Mesa 23.1

# Software Updates
- **Proton** [7.0-6](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-7.0-6-released/) has now become stable, adds compatiblity to eight new titles, improved video playback, and several bug fixes
- **Proton Experimental** [2.1.2023](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-experimental-update-2-1-2023/) fixes the 2K launcher. [1.31.2023](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-experimental-update-1-31-2023/) added compatibility to *Forspoken* and *Samurai Maiden*
- **GE-Proton** [7-48](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ge-proton7-48/) updates the usual set of tools and should include upstream fixes for the *Dead Space* remake
- **Heroic Games Launcher** [2.6.1](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/heroic-2.6.1/) adds new logo and theme, makes game settings easier to access. A [hotfix](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.6.2) was released shortly thereafter
- **Wine** [8.1](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/wine-8.1/) fixes bad performance on a few titles and fixes the GOG Galaxy crash

# Other
- immutable distros are [a PITA](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/are-we-getting-too-many-immutable-distros/)
- I reviewed [*SpongeBob: The Cosmic Shake*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/spongebob-cosmic-shake-review/). Not bad of a game
- free game to claim on itch.io: [*Anodyne*](https://han-tani.itch.io/anodyne). Better hurry and get it today, otherwise the price will go back up
- to add to the number of reverse-engineered titles available on PC, [*Zelda: A Link to the Past*](https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3) is the latest to enter the fray

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
