# Steam Deck
- *MultiVersus* [works on Deck](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/multiversus-works-on-deck/)
- *Halo Infinite* [runs on Deck](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/halo-infinite-now-runs-on-deck/); here's a [how-to](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/halo-infinite-on-deck-guide/)
- I did an interview with [the owner of Steam Deck HQ](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/interview-with-noah-from-steam-deck-hq/)
- new [beta Deck client update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/new-beta-deck-client-update-7-19-2022/) adds an Achievements section for games on the Steam menu

- [Q3 Decks](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/subtle-differences-between-q1-and-q3-steam-decks/) have some subtle differences than the OG units, though it seems they're mostly for the better
- be careful when using Desktop Mode; SteamOS is [highly outdated](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-growing-security-risk-with-steamos/)
- iFixit has [fans available in the US](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Miscellanous/Steam-Deck-Fan/IF260-002?o=2)
- hot-swapping SD cards is [technically safe](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/hot-swapping-sd-cards-on-steam-deck-is-okay-but-valve-plans-improvements/), but Valve is planning on improving this support
- Boiling Steam recently did a [piece](https://boilingsteam.com/steam-deck-the-ratio-of-verified-titles-is-falling-whats-happening/) on the fact that the number of games getting the Verified/Playable status have been slowing down lately

# Linux Hardware
- I have a [Launch Lite](https://system76.com/accessories/launch) review unit with which I am typing this post; review coming soon. I did an [unboxing video](https://youtu.be/q7oZCwv4qEA)
- Oryx Pro laptops from System76 have been [refreshed](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/oryx-pro-now-have-12th-gen-cpus/); now feature Alder Lake processors and RTX 3070/3080 Ti. Review unit coming in August!
- Musk is apparently [testing Steam on Teslas](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/tesla-to-demo-steam-for-more-in-car-gaming-soon-using-linux-proton/)

# Linux Games
- 23 new games [released this week](https://boilingsteam.com/new-steam-games-native-linux-2022-07-20/)
