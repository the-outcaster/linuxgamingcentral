# Steam Deck
- QR code for logging in [could be coming soon](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/qr-code-sign-in-could-be-coming-to-deck/)
- need a guide on emulating Switch games? [LTT has you covered](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ltt-guide-for-switch-emulation-on-deck/) (and the video is *still* up!)
- new [Deck client (which is currently beta)](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-client-update-7-7-2022/) can now automatically scale the Deck UI when connected to an external monitor, plus night time mode can be scheduled
- [avoid using the stock version of Firefox](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/firefox-outdated-on-steamos/) until we get an update to SteamOS
- I did a quick comparison between [the *Portal* series running on the Deck and the Switch](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/portal-series-deck-vs-switch/). Short version: Deck wins
- you can run DOSBox games on Deck thanks to [Gardiner's video](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/dosbox-on-deck-video-guide/)
- worried about SteamOS' loose security? Try [winesapOS](https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS)
- want an unofficial dock? Jsaux has [one](https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-docking-station) for $40

# Software Updates
- **Proton Experimental** [adds support for *Disgaea 5* and *Plants Vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-experimental-update-7-7-2022/)
- **Decky Loader** (formerly Plugin Loader) updated to [2.0.0](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/decky-loader-2.0.0-prerelease/) as a pre-release and updates the plugin store with React

# Other
- Denuvo is further ruining the DRM industry by trying to [protect DLC](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/30/2471835/0/en/Denuvo-by-Irdeto-launches-Denuvo-SecureDLC-the-industry-s-first-solution-to-protect-downloadable-content-against-piracy.html) in addition to the main game
- Xbox Game Pass streaming quality can be [improved by using an agent switcher](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/xbox-game-pass-quality-throttled-on-linux/). Come to find out from a Game Pass dev that it's [a result of lazy coding](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/8/23200363/xbox-cloud-gaming-linux-streaming-quality-user-agent-workaround). Does it come as much of a surprise, anyone?
- FSR 2.0 is being [modded into more and more games](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/amds-fsr-20-can-be-added-to-games-seriously-quickly-so-watch-out-nvidia-dlss), thanks to it being open-source. Watch out, NVIDIA
- GOL is now [13 years old](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/13-years-ago-we-appeared-online-happy-birthday-to-gamingonlinux/)
- looks like Elon Musk [is backing away from buying Twitter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922078413/tm2220599d1_ex99-p.htm)
