# Steam Deck
- new skins came in a few days ago! I put out a [video](https://youtu.be/5e-O3bYogkQ) applying a *Portal*-themed one. I'm also doing a [giveaway](https://twitter.com/linuxgamingctr/status/1555587449707003904) for the *Half-Life* and *Cyberpunk 2077* skins, more details coming soon!
- I also got the [DeckMate](https://deckmate.me) the same day I got the skins, review coming up soon!

GOL recently wrote a few [takeaway points](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/valve-spoke-to-ign-japan-about-the-steam-deck-heres-a-few-takeaway-points/) from the interview that Valve had with IGN Japan
- I did a comparison of [OpenGL vs. Vulkan](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/switch-emulation-on-deck-opengl-vs-vulkan/) when emulating Switch games. Vulkan, for the most part, wins
- SteamOS 3.3 [now stable](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/stable-steamos-3.3-update-and-deck-client-update/)
