# Steam Deck
- I did a [review](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-review/). Needless to say, it was controversial, as expected (though I do take back some of my opinions which aren't fact)
- new [beta client update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-client-beta-update-7-13-2022/) fixes a few Flatpaks from not successfully quitting and improves keyboard behavior when typing on both the trackpad and touchscreen
- 43 of the top 50 highest-reviewed games on Steam are [Steam Deck Playable](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/43-of-the-top-50-most-highly-reviewed-steam-games-are-steam-deck-playable/)
- over [4k verified/playable titles](https://www.protondb.com/)

# Native Linux Games
- want to force a native Linux game engine on certain titles? Try [Luxtorpeda](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/getting-luxtorpeda-on-deck/)
- *TMNT: Shredder's Revenge* [sells over a million copies](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/tmnt-shredders-revenge-available-on-arm/) in just its' first week
- 18 new Linux titles [shipped this week](https://boilingsteam.com/new-steam-games-native-linux-clients-2022-07-13/)

# Hardware
- new generation laptop from Tuxedo Computers is now available: the [Pulse Gen 2](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Linux-Hardware/Notebooks/15-16-inch/TUXEDO-Pulse-15-Gen2.tuxedo). Should be getting a review unit soon
- Tuxedo Computer's Aquaris cooling unit now [has Linux support](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=TUXEDO-Aquaris-Linux-Water)
- new [Launch Lite keyboard](https://system76.com/accessories/launch) by System76 is essentially a stripped down version of the Launch without the extra USB ports. Review unit coming soon!

# Software Updates
- **DXVK** [1.10.2](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/dxvk-1.10.2-released/) adds plenty of bug fixes and adds workarounds for a few specific titles
- **Proton Experimental** got two small updates this week: first for addressing the crash in [*Assassin's Creed: Origins*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-experimental-update-7-13-2022/) and fixing *Warframe*'s launcher, the second brings [automatic OSK support for *Final Fantasy XIV*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-experimental-update-7-15-2022/) when playing on Deck
- **Mint** [21 "Vanessa"](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/linux-mint-21-beta-released/) comes with plenty of overall improvements to the OS
- **WinesapOS** [3.1.1](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/winesapos-3.1.1-released/) allows booting the distro to a MicroSD card on Deck

# Other
- Boiling Steam had an [interview](https://boilingsteam.com/nobara-a-fedora-derivative-explained-by-glorious-eggroll-himself/) with Glorious Eggroll concerning his Fedora spinoff: the Nobara Project (*great* distro to try out, by the way)
- Unity acquires [ironSource](https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-ironsource), and needless to say, this has caused concern among the developer community. Game devs can always make the switch over to the excellent [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org), which is FOSS
- Valve is supposedly collaborating with GPD on [bringing SteamOS support to the GPD Win Max 2](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/gpd-talk-about-cooperating-with-valve-for-steamos-on-their-devices/), even though months earlier GPD were aggressively attacking the Deck by [comparing Deck videos with their own devices](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/gpd-are-getting-quite-desperate-against-the-steam-deck/)
- Aya Neo will be creating a Linux distro called [Aya Neo OS](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/ayaneo-to-have-their-own-ayaneo-os-based-on-linux/)
- AMD hiring an engineer to [improve the Linux graphics driver installation experience](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=AMD-Linux-Build-Engineer-Needed)
