# Steam Deck
- LTT installed a [heatsink/fan](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/cool-the-deck-with-heatsink-and-fan/) on the Deck
- turns out the Deck handles [*Super Smash Bros. Melee*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-and-melee/) quite well, as well as [*Metroid Prime Trilogy*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/metroid-prime-trilogy-on-deck/)
- [plugins](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-plugins/) can enhance the overall functionality of your Deck
- my fellow acquaintance podiki wrote an [article](https://boilingsteam.com/the-steam-decks-super-power-super-sleep/) about the modern wonders of the excellent sleep mode
- Steam Deck is back to being #1 for [Steam top sellers](https://steamdb.info/topsellers/)
- [Steam Deck HQ](https://steamdeckhq.com/) gets a UI makeover, go give the website owner a follow
- if you miss your pre-order opportunity after you get the email, you can [contact Steam support](https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamDeck) with a grace period of a few days
- if, for some reason, you wanted to use Desktop Mode in Gaming Mode, [you can do that](https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/uddyat/desktop_mode_within_gaming_mode/) with a bash script
- a user managed to [install a 2242 M.2 drive](https://twitter.com/TheSmcelrea/status/1539296261613944833) with a little bit of hacking, but this caught the attention of Valve employee Lawrence Yang, who [said](https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1540809830000013313) "please donâ€™t do this. The charger IC gets very hot and nearby thermal pads should not be moved.  In addition, most 2242 m.2 drives draw more power and get hotter than what Deck is designed for. This mod may appear to work but will significantly shorten the life of your Deck."
