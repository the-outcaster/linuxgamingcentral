# Steam Deck
- [you no longer have to wait in line when ordering a Deck](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-queue-is-now-gone-plus-deck-dock-now-available/). Official dock is also available for $90
- [Steam Deck Repo](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-repo/) is a nice place to get custom boot videos
- both SteamOS and the Deck client have both received an [update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steamos-3.3.2-and-steam-deck-client-update-10-5-2022/) to the stable branch with plenty of bug fixes, improvements, and new features
- apparently Valve has [sold over a million units](https://conf.kde.org/event/4/contributions/94/)
- GOL has a [guide](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/heres-how-to-play-overwatch-2-on-steam-deck-linux/) on how to get *Overwatch 2* running

- **GE-Proton** [7-36](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ge-proton7-36/) adds Protonfixes for a few titles, but disabled FSR. [7-37](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/ge-proton7-37-brings-fsr-back/) adds the FSR patch back
- **sc-controller** [0.4.8.9](https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller/releases/tag/v0.4.10-pre) gets Deck support

# Other
