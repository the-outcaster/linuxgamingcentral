A few days ago, [GE-Proton7-16](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-16) was released. Not too much going on in this update, but a patch was added to fix a crash in *Elden Ring* when playing said game with fsync. Video playback updates, as well as Steam client updates, have been fetched from upstream Proton. Of course tools like `dxvk` and `vkd3d-proton` have also been updated to the latest git.

Have a full look at the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-16). And don't forget, LGC has a [guide](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton_ge_tutorial/) to installing GE-Proton.
