Changes in this new beta includes the ability to choose what platform to install games to on Linux and Mac OS (for example, you can install the Windows version of a native game), change the theme, add games to your Favorites collection, and new ways to sort installed games. There's also bountiful UI bug fixes, performance improvements, and other features.
