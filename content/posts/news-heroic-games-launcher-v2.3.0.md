Heroic Games Launcher keeps getting better and better with every release. v2.3.0 has graduated out of the beta phase and has now become stable. Here's what we can look forward to with this new version.

First is **themes**. There's five different themes to select from in the Settings menu under General, including the one pictured in the cover. Great to add a personal touch to the app and make it more consistent with the coloring scheme of your desktop environment.

Next is **platform selection** on Mac OS and Linux. On Linux, when installing a game from GOG, you can choose whether you want to install the native version or install the Windows version.

Heroic will now **detect if there's a new version when launching**. If there is, you will get a prompt as to whether or not you want to download it.

**Games can now be added to your favorites.** Right-click the game in your library and select the appropriate option. **You can also hide games as well.**

Want to **customize the interface's font and font size**? You can now do so via the Accessibility tab.

Some **quality-of-life improvements** were added, including:
- sort game library alphabetically or by installed status
- show how much space there's left on the drive that a game is being installed to
- "more consistent" UI

Stuff was done on the backend to refactor such things as game status, bug fixes, and the launch command.

See the full patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.3.0).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
