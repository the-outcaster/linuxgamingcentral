System76 has partnered with HP, bringing their Pop!_OS distribution to the HP Dev One laptop.

Specs are as follows:
- Octo-core Ryzen 7 PRO
- 16 GB DDR4 @ 3200MHz
- 1 TB PCIe NVMe storage
- 14" FHD anti-glare display

The laptop features a "Super" key that replaces the Windows logo that's typically put on every keyboard. The product, according to the [official website](https://hpdevone.com/), is aimed towards developers. The laptop will be priced at **$1,099.** No details yet as to when it's going to launch.

I also wanted to inform of an awesome opportunity that I have. I will be doing a paid review series on this very laptop sometime in June. I will keep you updated as the weeks go by.
