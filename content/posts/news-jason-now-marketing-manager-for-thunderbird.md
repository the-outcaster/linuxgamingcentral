For those who aren't aware, Jason Evangelho is the creator of the [Linux For Everyone YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LinuxForEveryone). He's also a writer at [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/?sh=5c6360fed36f). He's probably got a lot more on his plate now that he recently [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/killyourfm/status/1521196554790572034) about being the marketing manager for Mozilla Thunderbird, a very popular email client.

Per the Tweet, Jason mentioned that as the marketing manager, he will "be helping out with comms on social media (including here), crafting content for the website, and handling the Thunderbird newsletter." Based on some of the replies I've seen in the thread it looks like UI changes will be coming, a mobile app is being developed, and Jason will make sure Thunderbird is more well-known in the community. If you have other ideas, you can contact Jason at jason@thunderbird.net. Looks like exciting times ahead for Thunderbird!
