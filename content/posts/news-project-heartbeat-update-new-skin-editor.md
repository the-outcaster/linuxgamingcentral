Good things just seem to keep coming to [*Project Heartbeat*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/project_heartbeat_review/). Last month the game got an [audio engine overhaul](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/project_heartbeat_new_audio_engine/). Now we've got a UI skin editor, with Steam workshop integration. You can use your own textures and fonts. Even animated textures are supported. Apparently a health system has been incorporated as well. Meaning if you miss too many beats, game over.

Since this is a beta, you'll need to opt-in to the `beta` branch in the game's properties menu.

*Project Heartbeat* is available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1216230/Project_Heartbeat/) (it's native to Linux).
