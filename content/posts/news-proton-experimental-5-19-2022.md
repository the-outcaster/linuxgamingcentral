Following [last week's update to Proton Experimental](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/news-proton-experimental-updated-with-more-playable-titles/), Valve/CodeWeavers are back at it once again with [today's update](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog/_compare/4b86d2297c6e6e304c0c66094b4855e59867b17c...010eae4a18cbbdcd4509329cf025cc850a4d8b8a). Not only do we get the usual round of bug fixes and newly playable games, but those of you who previously [couldn't play *Final Fantasy XIV* due to the new launcher](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/t9ey3v/newest_update_breaks_launcher_for_linux_users/) should now be able to play the game again. No way Gabe was going to let this game slip by when he plays it himself.

Newly playable titles include:
- [*We Were Here Forever*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1341290/We_Were_Here_Forever/)
- [*Cities XXL*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/313010/Cities_XXL/)
- [*Cladun X2*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/206250/Cladun_X2/)
- [*Succubus x Saint*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1078370/Succubus_x_Saint/)
- *Cursed Armor*

Bug fixes include:
- the new [FF XIV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/39210/FINAL_FANTASY_XIV_Online/) launcher should work with Proton now
- [*The Turing Test*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/499520/The_Turing_Test/) should no longer crash in chapter 4
- FPS in [*Street Fighter V*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/310950/Street_Fighter_V/) should be improved during online matches
- [*Mini Ninjas*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/35000/Mini_Ninjas/) should now have controller support

Video playback has been fixed in:
- [*Solasta: Crown of the Magister*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1096530/Solasta_Crown_of_the_Magister/)
- [*Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1110100/Power_Rangers_Battle_for_the_Grid/)
- [*The Room 4: Old Sins*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361320/The_Room_4_Old_Sins/)

I forgot to mention in last week's post that you need **Mesa 22 / Nvidia drivers 510.47 or newer** when playing DX12 games through Proton Experimental.
