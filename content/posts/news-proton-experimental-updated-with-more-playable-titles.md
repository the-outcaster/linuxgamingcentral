Proton Experimental gets its first [update](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog/_compare/e0524828df04563aa50ed7ca4ed4b0a7538062e8...9a87dd7a3c3b4cbdcabf5f5ddde9864bb33b1d77) for the month of May. Newly playable titles include:
- [*Gary Grigsby's War in the East*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370540/Gary_Grigsbys_War_in_the_East/)/[*West*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/644710/Gary_Grigsbys_War_in_the_West/)
- [*Beneath a Steel Sky*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1368340/Beneath_a_Steel_Sky/)

Video playback has been fixed in:
- [*Street Fighter V*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/310950/Street_Fighter_V/)
- [*Disintegration*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/536280/Disintegration/)
- [*POSTAL 4: No Regerts*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/707030/POSTAL_4_No_Regerts/)

A few bug fixes were added, specifically for [*Elden Ring*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/) and [*DEATHLOOP*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252330/DEATHLOOP/). The former should no longer crash after an extended gameplay session, while the latter should be able to resume after a long system suspend. Also, [`vkd3d-proton`](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton) has been updated to the latest development work since v2.6.

An update should be available in your Steam library, simply download it to enjoy these new features.
