Slippi Launcher version [2.5.0](https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-launcher/releases/tag/v2.5.0) released a few days ago. The developers acknowledged that this is a big version difference from the previous 2.1.15 release and said that they've "been hard at work on a lot of developer side improvements that will make it easier for us to work on some big features we're really excited about."

So first thing's up, Dolphin updates are now transparent and done in the background. This means less waiting for the application to start. Bugs have been fixed. This ranges from stopping the broadcast if the connection fails, display names and connect codes are now properly shown in the replay browser, and here's the important thing for Linux users: **`--no-sandbox` is no longer required in order to launch the application.**

I've heard some people saying that they've needed to add this flag on Fedora and other distros, but now that should be a thing of the past. The less complicated it is to launch an app, the better!

Some other bonuses have been thrown in. The app for M1 chips is now native, security has been improved, and those on Windows no longer need admin privileges to install.

Head over to the [release](https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-launcher/releases/tag/v2.5.0) page to download. There's an AppImage waiting right there for you, the Linux gamer. Just make sure to mark it as executable before running. Follow LGC's [guide](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/slippi_guide/) for more info.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
