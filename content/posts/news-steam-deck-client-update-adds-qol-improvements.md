Does Valve ever take a break? In addition to the new [Proton Experimental update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/news-proton-experimental-5-19-2022/) from today, there's also a new [Steam Deck client update](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3220648637502115304). This update mostly focuses on quality-of-life improvements, ranging from:
- new status icons on lock screen, including battery, network, time
- battery % can be toggled in the header
- performance profiles can now be set to factory default
- plenty of bug fixes, such as the wrong FPS being set when selecting a performance profile, keyboard theme not being applied in certain situations, login issues with the '/' character, and a host of other fixes

Full changelog is as follows:
```
- Lock Screen now includes battery status, network status, and time
- Added an option to show battery percentage in the header. This can be toggled in Settings > General.
- Added ability to re-claim Steam Deck rewards if they were accidentally redeemed by another account, and Steam Support has removed those items.
- Added a button to reset an application's performance profile to system default
- Reduced login time for users with thousands of screenshots
- Perf overlay setting is no longer stored as part of the per-app performance profile
- Fixed per-app performance profiles restoring the wrong FPS limit
- Fixed an issue with keyboard theme not being applied the first time the keyboard was shown
- Fixed an issue with keyboard theme not being applied when there is no connection to Steam
- Fixed pinch-to-zoom gestures being active in certain places - preventing UI from being unexpectedly zoomed in
- Fixed some focus issues in the Library when going back from a game's detail page. It should give focus back to the last focused item properly.
- Fixed various issues with the Re-order Controller dialog
- Fixed login issues with users that have a '/ 'character in their profile name
```

Also, the beta SteamOS 3.2 has further been [updated](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3269060419612777126/) with the following:
```
- Updated fan controller - now smarter, more stable, and quieter overall
- Performance HUD now shows a more accurate reading of VRAM used (previously would cap out at 1G used)
- Added more internal resolution options for games to choose from
- Fixed gain staging, resulting in higher max volume, and removes white noise coming through 3.5mm jack with some headphones.
- Fixed PipeWire and Steam failing to elevate their thread priorities
- Fixed the language dropdown in the Warframe launcher
```
