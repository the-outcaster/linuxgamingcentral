# Software Updates
- [ChimeraOS 32](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/chimeraos_32_released/) was released this week, adding the usual software upgrades, fixes for Aya Neo, and improvements to certain areas
- openrazer -- a collection of Linux drivers for various Razer peripherals -- version [3.3.0](https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/releases/tag/v3.3.0) released, adding support for a plethora of new devices, improvements to the software, and a collection of bug fixes
- EndeavourOS, based on Arch, has received the ["Apollo" release](https://endeavouros.com/news/the-apollo-release-has-landed/). This adds new features and bug fixes during the installation process, as well as after the system is installed. It also includes a new window manager called Worm
- *Splitgate*, a FPS with native Linux support, recently got an [update](https://www.splitgate.com/blogs/matchmaker-matchmaker-make-me-a-match) that improves matchmaking
- Box86/Box64 just got updated to [0.1.8](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/releases/tag/v0.1.8), adds a ton of improvements and bug fixes. Also supposedly allows Steam and Steam Play to run on ARM-based platforms

# Hardware
- [Pinebuds are a thing](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/pinebuds_are_a_thing/), more info to come next month
- The [Byte](https://us.starlabs.systems/pages/byte) by Star Labs is their first desktop unit and comes with a Ryzen processor
- The [Tensorbook](https://lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/laptops/tensorbook) by Lambda and Razer is a powerful deep learning laptop with Ubuntu, an RTX 3080, 16 GB VRAM, i7-11800H, 64 GB DDR4, 2 TB NVMe, and a 165 Hz/1440p screen

# Steam Deck
- The Steam Deck will [get ray-tracing support soon](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/yes-the-steam-deck-will-eventually-get-ray-tracing-once-the-amd-gpu-driver-matures/)
- The original *Portal* was recently [updated](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/400/view/3213890057674875345) with DXVK cache priming for the Deck. Supposedly this means [improved performance](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/valve-updates-portal-to-improve-steam-deck-performance/)
- According to GamingOnLinux, 2022 is officially [the year of Linux gaming](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/2022-is-officially-the-year-of-linux-gaming/), thanks in no small part to the Steam Deck
- [54 of the top 100 Steam games work on the Deck](https://boilingsteam.com/54-of-the-top-100-steam-games-work-on-the-steam-deck/)
- Over [2,200 verified/playable titles on the Deck](https://boilingsteam.com/2200-games-on-the-steam-deck/). Apparently the verification process is slowing down too. That's a good sign as Valve is probably being more thorough about the testing process
- Apparently [the Steam Deck can come with one of two fans](https://boilingsteam.com/steam-deck-whistling-blame-the-fan/). One is louder than the other

# Emulation
- [MPR](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/mpr/) -- play *Metroid Prime* in HD with this mod (need to use Wine for now). Got a video recording on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/2EVy0yo0-Wc) as well

# Other
- Record desktop videos while keeping your CPU usage down with [GPU Screen Recorder](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/gpu_screen_recorder/) (NVIDIA only for now)
- Games that are now playable through Proton are [*New World*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/new_world_now_running/) and [*Back 4 Blood*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/back4blood_now_playable_on_proton/)
- Like the Budgie DE? Have a look at the project's upcoming plans with [workshops](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/buddies_of_budgie/) coming later this month
- Can't play *Halo: MCC* anymore? That's because of [new anti-cheat files](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/halo-the-master-chief-collection-broke-on-linux-and-steam-deck-heres-a-quick-fix/) put in the game. Just delete the `easyanticheat` folder (or remove the `easyanticheat.so` file inside) and you should be able to play the game offline again. It's a sign that 343 may be adding Proton/Steam Deck support for multiplayer soon!
- Google [details](https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/bringing-steam-to-chromeos) why virtual machines are used to play Steam games on ChromeOS
- Ubuntu market share in the Linux gaming world [is plummeting](https://boilingsteam.com/ubuntu-continues-falling-like-a-rock-as-a-gaming-distro/). Good for people recognizing the controversy that is Canonical
