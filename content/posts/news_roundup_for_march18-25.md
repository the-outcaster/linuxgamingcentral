# Steam Deck
- On the desktop, users can now get an alert on the Steam client when their pre-order is ready to purchase
{{< tweet OnDeck "1507439732128591873" >}}
- It won't be long before we reach the 2,000 mark for Steam Deck verified/playable titles. So far we've got [over 1,700](https://boilingsteam.com/1700-games-on-the-steam-deck-with-valkyria-chronicles-4-as-verified/)
- It seems Bandai Namco is the company that has [the most Deck verified/playable titles out of any other publisher](https://boilingsteam.com/the-publisher-with-the-best-steam-deck-support/). They have 20 at the time of writing this
- The Steam Deck client [got an update](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3131696829185214771) with bug fixes, performance improvements across the Steam store, and new features
- Discord Overlay now [works on the Deck](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/discover-overlay-is-a-discord-chat-ui-that-now-works-on-steam-deck/)
- Users can now [report](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3186865924592128220/) whether a game was correctly verified or not. They can also personally [add feedback](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3131696829170735771) to games they play to help assist with the growth of Steam Deck Verified/Playable titles

# Ubuntu
- Ubuntu got a new logo. As Gardiner Byrant put it, [it looks like a cock ring](https://youtu.be/9C6YAtVB-1I?t=93). No, you can't unsee it now
{{< tweet gardiner_bryant "1504512906062450693" >}}
- Continuing with the controversy that is Ubuntu, apparenty [Firefox on that platform is only available as a Snap now](https://old.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/tjwsza/firefox_now_only_available_via_snap/). Thanks, Canonical


# Software Releases/Spotlights
- Godot 3 has recently been updated to [3.4.4](https://godotengine.org/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-4-4), which mostly adds bug fixes
- RetroArch [1.10.2](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/blob/master/CHANGES.md) is out with a bunch of new stuff added
- Interested in an open-source minigolf game? Try [Open Golf](https://github.com/mgerdes/Open-Golf)
- Need an open-source Twitter app? Try [ModernDeck](https://github.com/dangeredwolf/ModernDeck). Thanks to Jason from [Linux For Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUI6uuBavfw) for bringing this to my attention
- [Native Linux titles released on Steam this week](https://boilingsteam.com/new-steam-games-with-native-linux-clients-2022-03-22-edition/) include *Toziuha Night: Dracula's Revenge* (seems very akin to *Castlevania*), *Jump Challenge!*, *Officer Management 101*, *Fire on Fight* (looks similar to *Call of Duty*), and a few others
- There's an [unofficial PC port of *Zelda: Ocarina of Time*](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/zelda-ocarina-of-time-pc-port/). This includes with it keyboard support, ultrawide resolution support, modding support, gyroscopic aiming, and HD graphics. The number of days it has will likely be not many before Nintendo shuts the project down
- Linux Mint Debian Edition [version 5](https://linuxmint.com/rel_elsie.php) was released
- NVIDIA driver version [510.60.02](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/nvidia-5106002-driver-rolls-out-for-linux/) was released that adds support for new GPUs and adds a few bug fixes
- GNOME finally got a dark theme with [version 42](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/gnome-42-released-with-the-new-global-dark-style-preference/)
- Proton Experimental was [updated](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog/_compare/24c430ae5584a0ed0fd79ad43ad6c1ab00bd9ee8...15d6fa116e56d5c0206201606d1b908c76c946b9) yesterday with more compatible games, bug fixes, and `vkd3d-proton` was updated to v2.6
- Wine [7.5](https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.5) was released with the typical set of bug fixes and other features added

# Other
- Destination Linux had an [interview with Emma Marshal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Ne_zB0tuo) of System76. Recommend watching it to see the status of their upcoming [Rust-based DE](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/system76_new_de_written_in_rust/) and other interesting stories
- Steam for ChromeOS [is finally here](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-announce-alpha-quality-steam-on-chrome-os-is-now-actually-here/)
- AMD's FSR 2.0 [is in the works](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/amd-reveal-more-on-fidelityfx-super-resolution-20-fsr/)
- NVIDIA will soon [get gamescope support](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/nvidia-working-with-valve-to-get-gamescope-working-on-their-drivers/). How soon? Probably five years (I don't know; that's a bit of an exaggeration)
