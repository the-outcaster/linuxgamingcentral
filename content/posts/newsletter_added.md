I've added a newsletter service for those of you who wish to get their LGC news delivered to their inbox. The newsletter is **hand-curated**, powered by [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/), and will be sent every night around 10-11 PM EST. The newsletter will contain the posts that were made on that day. If I can figure it out I will try to make the newsletter feed automated and sent at the exact time every night.

You can subscribe through the [subscription](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/subscribe/) link at the top in the navigation bar. Once you've entered your email address and hit the Subscribe button, you will be presented with a new window with CAPTCHA to verify that you're human. An email will get sent to your inbox to verify your email address. Click the link in the email to do so, and you'll be all set.

Note that if you're using Gmail or Hotmail, the email may show up in the Spam folder (not that I think anyone uses Hotmail anyway). The newsletter doesn't contain any ads; just links to the posts with a cover image over each one. Here's what it'll look like on desktop:

On mobile (with dark theme on Gmail):

I will get notified of new subscribers:

If you're paranoid about me seeing your email address, you can always use a fake one, even if it's something like `lgc_sucks@your.face`.

I'll also get stats on how many clicks the newsletter gets:

Note that there isn't any way I can disable this.

If you no longer wish to get a newsletter from me, there's an Unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email. One click and done!

That's going to wrap it up for this post. I will be sending a newsletter tonight, so [get subscribed](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/subscribe/) if you want LGC news delivered to your inbox (and also to test to make sure the newsletter works for you)!

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
