According to a post by [Nintendo Life](https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/07/nickelodeon-kart-racers-3-confirmed-for-launch-this-fall), it appears that Best Buy had leaked the sequel to *Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix* a few weeks ago, *Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway*. Based on the information we have so far, it looks like it will be releasing later this fall on October 7, just a day less than a year after the release of *Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl*, and will be coming with a similar $50 price tag. A welcome change is it will have voice acting, unlike the previous installment.

A few days after the post, GameMill Entertainment indeed confirmed the game will be coming. But now the boxart for the game has supposedly been leaked:

I don't know where this boxart came from; I just found it on [r/AllStarBrawl](https://www.reddit.com/r/AllStarBrawl/comments/w1fg0w/nickelodeon_kart_racers_3_slime_speedway_boxart/) and no one has commented on where the source has come from. I also find the "T" rating to be very odd; that's not like Nickelodeon to have a more mature-themed game (although I actually kind of dig the idea).

At any rate there you go; I have a feeling even though it will have voiced lines the game is going to be a rushed, low-budget product. Seems typical of anything from GameMill.
