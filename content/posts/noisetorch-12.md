A few weeks ago, [NoiseTorch](https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch), the popular application that filters out background noise from your microphone, seemed to have been [compromised](https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch/releases/tag/0.11.6). After a few [audits](https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch/discussions/275) were made by the community, it appears that no malicious code has been found.

In version [0.12.0](https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch/releases/tag/v0.12.0), a few updates have also landed. Some C components were removed as part of a "small spring cleanup," a more clear UI better indicates to the user what's going on, and security has been improved by adding "several GitHub actions to automatically validate and verify the code we have written and will write in the future."

See the full release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch/releases/tag/v0.12.0).
