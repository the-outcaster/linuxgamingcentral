A while back I had talked about the new [NVK driver](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/nvk/) that will eventually replace NVIDIA's Nouveau driver for Linux. We're starting to see some slow, yet steady progress on the driver.

Mastodon user [@etarsis](https://chaos.social/@karolherbst/109666048560595911) managed to get [*The Talos Principle*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/257510/The_Talos_Principle/) running through this open-source driver. At a slideshow, headache-inducing five frames-per-second, and at just a tiny resolution of 1,024 x 576 pixels, it's not exactly ready for prime time just yet. Still, this is great progress. We can actually get games to run at this point, even though the framerates are poor. It will be *awesome* to finally have an open-source alternative to the proprietary NVIDIA drivers once this becomes more mature.
