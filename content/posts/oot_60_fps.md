Leave it up to Nintendo's fans to properly fix emulating Nintendo 64 games (or actually, play the game on native hardware), rather than the crappy service that members get on the Switch for $50/year.

I won't re-hash the fact that *Zelda: Ocarina of Time* got a reverse-engineered port to PC. Chances are you probably already knew that. What you might not have noticed, however, is with [Open Ocarina](https://github.com/blawar/ooot), there is an experimental 60 FPS feature, in addition to widescreen support, support for higher resolutions, gyroscope, and modern controls. Someone [got it running](https://youtu.be/5pI80eQmkm8) and based on the looks from it, it looks great! Looks three times as smooth versus it's native 20 FPS counterpart. In the video I've also noticed there's a free look camera and an HD icon set. It probably won't be long before we get HD graphics. Do keep in mind that according to the description of the video, the 60 FPS feature is "buggy."

There are instructions for compiling the game on Linux (need a legal copy of the N64 game), although the GitHub page says "Linux does not currently work." Hopefully it won't be long, as I'd like to give this a spin myself, maybe even write a guide for it.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
