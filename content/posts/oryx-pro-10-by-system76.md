The folks over at System76 have been quite busy. A few months ago the Oryx Pro got [Alder Lake processors and RTX 30-series Ti GPUs](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/oryx-pro-now-have-12th-gen-cpus/). And just last week they released the new version of the [Thelio desktop](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/system76-unveils-new-thelio/) with swappable accents. Now they've upgraded the Oryx Pro once more, both in terms of the screen and the RAM.

The **RAM has been upgraded from DDR4 to DDR5**. According to the press documentation, this newer class of RAM boasts "50 percent faster transfer speeds" over the previous generation while drawing less power. Particularly useful for those of you who work with large files/datasets.

The next big feature to come with this refresh is a **4K, 60hz OLED screen**. So I guess I don't have to complain any more that the [previous-gen model was only available at 1080p](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/oryx-pro-by-system76-review/). Plus, the OLED screen seems like a nice bonus.

They definitely did their research when it comes to gaming:
