The AMD-powered Pangolin laptop by System76 will be returning. Not only will it return, but it will come with quite a few upgrades. Namely:
- AMD Ryzen 6800U processor
- DDR5 memory
- PCIe 4 NVMe
- refresh rate increased from 60 Hz to 144 Hz
- physical privacy switch for both the webcam and mic
- 70 Wh battery -- supposedly this will make the laptop last for 10 hours on average
- magnesium alloy body -- should withstand "the occasional ding or drop"

It's nice to finally have an option for AMD for System76's hardware. The 6800U in particular means it will get performance similar to [the Deck](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/valve-doesnt-consider-6800u-handhelds-as-competition/), if not a little better. The battery is almost *double* that of the Deck, so that will certainly help (I'd wager 3-4 hours of gaming battery life). The 144 Hz refresh rate is definitely a welcome upgrade as well.

Specs are as follows:
- Operating System: Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Processor: AMD Ryzen™ 7 6800U: 2.7 up to 4.7 GHz - 8 Cores - 16 Threads
- Display: 15.6" 1920×1080 FHD, Matte Finish, 144 Hz
- Graphics: AMD Radeon™ 680M
- Memory: 32 GB LPDDR5 @ 6400 MHz
- Storage: 2 x M.2 SSD(PCIe NVMe). Up to 4TB total.
- Expansion: 3 × USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1 × USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, SD Card Reader
- Networking: Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2
- Video Ports: HDMI 2.0
- Camera: 1.0M 720p HD Webcam
- Battery: Li-Ion - 70 Wh
- Dimensions: 14.59" × 9.76" × 0.71" (37.06 × 24.79 × 1.80 cm)
- Weight: 3.95 lbs (1.79kg)

The Pangolin will start at **$1,300** and start shipping "around the first half of February." You can see more details on [System76's website](https://system76.com/laptops/pangolin-teaser). I might be able to get my hands on a review unit, so stay tuned for that!

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
