We finally got an [update](https://www.pine64.org/2022/05/31/may-update-worth-the-wait/) from Pine64. It looks like from here on out the monthly newsletter will be posted on the 28th of each month, though this is tentative.

It's been a whole year since you've been able to buy a Pinebook Pro. Now you can finally get one in late June or early July. Price will remain the same at $219, but the small caveat is the battery is 400 mAh smaller than the 2021 models, which had 10,000 mAh.

The PinePhone Pro will also be available to purchase around the same time as the Pinebook Pro, and it looks like the development of the camera is moving along smoothly.

One other thing I wanted to highlight from Pine64's blog post is Lukasz Erecinski's initial impressions of the prototype PineBuds. He describes them as being "nice, really small, and light." The default tuning "sounds good, offering a pleasnt V-shaped curve." Of course, users don't have to use the default tuning -- they could create and use a more flat-sounding signature if they wanted to. That's the benefit of the customizable firmware.

Here's one of the concept renders of the PineBuds. This will probably change in the future.

As for the carrying case, the lid will use a sliding mechanism rather than hinges. The prototype case is a bit on the large side, but that means a larger-capacity charger. Keep in mind that both this and the PineBuds themselves are in a very early state of development, so both will likely change as far as appearance, etc. No word on when these will become available to purchase.

There's plenty of other things going on at Pine64, including updates on the EU version of the Pine Store, Quartz64 and SOQuartz availablity, PinePhone keyboard, and InfiniTime progress; check out the [post](https://www.pine64.org/2022/05/31/may-update-worth-the-wait/) for more info!
