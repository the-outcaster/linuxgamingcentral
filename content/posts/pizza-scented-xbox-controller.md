Forget about those gaming weekends where you went to your friends' house for a LAN party and ate pizza till it came out of your ears. Forget about those ["gamer" candles](https://wickandskull.com/collections/candles). The nuts over at Microsoft thought it'd be better to have a pizza slice attached to the back of a TMNT-themed Xbox controller and have it spit out a pizza-scented diffuser, so you can have that scent of pizza floating up to your nostrils even when pizza isn't around.

"In celebration of ['Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem's] August 2023 release, we are giving away a limited number of exclusive ooze green, pizza-scented Xbox Wireless Controllers," states the [Xbox blog post](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/07/24/pizza-scented-xbox-and-tmnt-mutant-mayhem-controller/). "Designed to deliver the smell of the Turtles’ beloved meal to your game time, these exclusive Xbox Wireless Controllers come with a built-in scent diffuser shaped like a slice of delicious New York ‘za."

Not necessarily related to Linux, but I found the concept so bizarre I thought it might be worth sharing.

These controllers aren't for sale. The only way you'll be able to get them is by following Xbox Game Pass on Twitter (or, what Elon has now branded as "X", with the logo being very reminiscent of the X.org logo) and retweeting their [sweepstakes tweet](https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass/status/1683492348234199041). Although you can apparently use the controller in-person in New York City at the Microsoft Experience Center on August 2nd.

As bizarre as this concept is, I kinda wish these controllers *were* for sale.

What are your thoughts?
