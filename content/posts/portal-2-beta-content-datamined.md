Just a few days ago, Valve released the *Portal* series to the Nintendo Switch, known as *Portal: Companion Collection*. It didn't take long for dataminers to discover new, unreleased beta content that never showed up in the final product as a result of this port. From [Ossy Flawol's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/p5kAcIx6mDk), it appears there are at least nine beta maps from *Portal 2*. The video then goes on to show these maps as Chell explores them. A lot of them have less overall detail from the complete level that you actually see in-game, others are tests for the different types of cubes available.

Nonetheless, these are some pretty fascinating discoveries, and I imagine more and more details will be found as time goes on. Someone's already got [*Half-Life 2* running on the Switch](https://www.thegamer.com/switch-modder-gets-half-life-2-running-via-portal/) via the original *Portal*. All of this being said, though, [don't expect *Portal 3* anytime soon.](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/portal-3-wont-happen/)
