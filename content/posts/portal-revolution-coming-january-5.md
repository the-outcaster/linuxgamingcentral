There are a few *Portal* mods that are in the works, including [*Portal 2: Desolation*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/portal_2_desolation/). But there's one mod in particular that actually has a release date: *Portal: Revolution*.

The game is "a fan-made mod for *Portal 2* which plays before the events of Portal 2 in the dead and decaying Aperture facility." You are guided by the personality core known as Stirling, in the hopes that you'll come across "a powerful device capable of restoring Aperture to its former glory." Featuring 40 puzzles with "new test elements," the playthrough is expected to last about eight hours. The difficulty "starts where *Portal 2* stops" but "no puzzles require advanced tricky movement."

Since the mod is using a custom version of *CS:GO*'s Source engine, this allows the small team of just seven members "to introduce many mechanics and improvements to the engine to create an experience which would be impossible in *Portal 2*." And from the looks of it on the Steam store page, it looks like there will be a native Linux version of the mod.

Over the weekend, the team released [a trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXczxIIvXJ0), which so far has gotten over 260k views. They mention in a [blog post](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/601360/view/5872192466321613944?l=english) that the game "is 99% complete" and will release on **January 5th, 2024.**

I'm really excited for this one. I'm just hoping it won't be as difficult as [*Portal: Reloaded*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/) or [*Portal Stories: Mel*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/317400/Portal_Stories_Mel/).

See the [Steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/601360/Portal_Revolution/) for more details.
