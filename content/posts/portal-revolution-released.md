Exciting news for you *Portal* fans: a new fan-made mod, known as [*Portal: Revolution*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/portal-revolution-coming-january-5/), just released over the weekend. Initially planned for release on Friday, it had to get delayed by a day due to Valve needing to "review and accept the game for release" according to the game's [Discord](https://discord.gg/2FzrSVsM7). But it's here now after eight years of development!

I've only played the first couple of levels. Puzzles tend to hurt my brain. Fortunately though the difficulty isn't anywhere near as bad as, say, *Portal Stories: Mel*. So far it's rated "Very Positive" on Steam with over 2k reviews. As expected, the game has played *wonderfully* on my Deck OLED. Solid 90 FPS at native resolution with the highest graphics settings. And guess what? There's a native Linux version!

Have you played the game? What are your thoughts so far?

The game is available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/601360/Portal_Revolution/) and free to download for anyone who owns *Portal 2*. A big thanks to the team at Second Face Software for making this mod a reality!

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
