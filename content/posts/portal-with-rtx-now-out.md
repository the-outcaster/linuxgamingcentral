Great news, *Portal with RTX* is [out now!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2012840/Portal_with_RTX/)

![Portal with RTX Steam store page](/images/portal_rtx/store_page.png)

Per the Steam store page description:
> Experience the critically acclaimed and award-winning Portalâ„¢ reimagined with ray tracing in this free DLC for Portal owners. Start thinking with portals, with RTX on.

I'd love to report how it runs...if I had a RTX GPU. I should have just kept the [Thelio](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/thelio-review/) as an excuse to try it. If you don't have a RTX GPU clicking "Play Game" won't do anything.

But who knows, [GamingOnLinux](https://gamingonlinux.com) might have a report on it later today or later this week.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
