A *Portal 2* mod that's been in the works for several years is [*Portal 2: Desolation*](https://emberspark.games/desolation/). It's a fan-made mod that features a brand new campaign, a new model for shooting portals, new characters, and more. From the looks of it it's set to be the community's version of *Portal 3*, set years after the events of *Portal 2* (I wonder if J.K. Simmons will re-prise his role as Cave Johnson).

One major update has occured to this mod -- the team behind *Portal 2: Desolation* has updated the Source engine to include [real-time lighting, as well as improved reflections and surface lighting](https://emberspark.games/desolation/news/mar2022/). Previously, the Source engine only used baked-in lighting, and could prove to be a time-consuming process when recompiling any maps. The result of this overhaul means better visual quality and faster development and testing.

It had been nearly a year-and-a-half since EmberSpark's last progress report, back in December of 2020. That's how much work it took to re-implement the lighting and the graphics overhaul.

Unfortunately the release is "still a number of years away" according to EmberSpark's [FAQ](https://emberspark.games/desolation/faq/). If you're familiar with the Source engine though and want to get involved with the development of the mod, you can fill their [Google form](https://forms.gle/vhXXfKyuqCucMLN89).

I'm really looking forward to trying this mod out when it does become available.
