In case you hadn't caught up on the news, the founder of PolyMC -- a popular *Minecraft* launcher -- was [exerting toxic behavior towards the other developers and to the project itself](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/if-you-use-polymc-for-minecraft-you-should-switch-away-now/). Fortunately we have our alternatives. [Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher) happens to be one of them. This launcher was actually created by the developers who got kicked out of the PolyMC project by the creator. It's open-source, mostly written in C++, using Qt as the frontend, and has the GPLv3 license.

As the project is in its' early stages, I wasn't even able to create a *Minecraft* profile (I'll be honest, I've never touched *Minecraft* in my life). As a result I couldn't play online. It works with an offline account though. So far it's looking very nice. You can choose between several instances, from vanilla *Minecraft*, to *CurseForge*, *Modrinth*, and others. You can also import your own from a zip file. Stable as well as experimental releases can be chosen, and you can use Forge, Fabric, Quilt, or LiteLoader mod loaders.

There's also *plenty* of different options to choose from, including the application's theme color, whether or not to use your system's discrete GPU, toggle MangoHUD, toggle GameMode, window size and height, and everything in-between.

Note that in order to play *Minecraft* online, you'll need to log in with a Microsoft account. You can also use a Mojang account, but apparently this is for offline use only. You can play offline without needing to log in to anything.

Builds can be found on the [Actions](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/actions) page on their GitHub. When you select a build, there's an AppImage available for Linux. There's also a portable build that you can download. Technically Prism Launcher is also available on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/prismlauncher), but I don't recommend installing this way for the time being, as I was unable to download the PlaceholderMC package, which it requires.

Check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher). Installation instructions will be provided there soon, as well as their own website. In the meantime you check out their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/prismlauncher).
