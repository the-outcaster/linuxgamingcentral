Good stuff just keeps on coming to the [anime rhythm game](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/project_heartbeat_review/). Update 0.16 gets plenty of features and bug fixes, ranging from an updated audio engine to support of the songs from [*Project DIVA Mega Mix+*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761390/Hatsune_Miku_Project_DIVA_Mega_Mix/). Here's the list of updates:
- new song: [Confession](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6HU0i2PxDk), by Takanashi Koubou
- updated audio engine, which "achieves higher levels of memory safety and performance while using less memory" (should produce a 10% improvement in memory consumption and faster loading times, maybe this will increase the Deck's battery life as well?). There's also "much faster audio normalizations"
- you can now load the full song list from Mega Mix+, provided that you have a copy of the game. Useful for playing MegaMix+ songs on Deck for improved battery life (since Mega Mix+ itself is more demanding with 3D animations and such)
- new [streamer mode](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2863105679&snr=1_2108_9__2107)
- improved audio downloader
- a crying Aiko appears when you get a game over
- other smaller improvements and bug fixes
