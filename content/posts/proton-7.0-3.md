Newly playable titles with this release include:

`Windows.Gaming.Input` is now supported. Text rendering in the Rockstar Launcher has been improved. There's better steering wheel detection, improved FPS in online matches in *Street Fighter V*, xinput re-ordering support on the Deck, and performance has been improved in *Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice*.

In addition to all of this, the following software packages have been upgraded:
- Wine Mono to 7.3.0 (contains several bug fixes and an upgrade to FNA)
- dxvk-nvapi to 0.5.4 (minor bug fix)
- dxvk to 1.10.1-57-g279b4b7e

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/releases/tag/proton-7.0-3). An update should be available in your Steam library for Proton 7.0.
