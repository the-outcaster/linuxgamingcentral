Quite a number of bugs have been fixed, including game-specific fixes for *Elden Ring*, *Final Fantasy XIV*, and *Civilization IV*:

- Fix graphical glitches in *Cossacs 3* on desktop.
- Fix garbled audio in *Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak*.

Some improvements have been made:

- Improve performance of *HROT*.
- Improve video playback for many games that previously required targeted hacks.
- Reduce space used by game prefixes if filesystem supports copy on write.

Finally, DXVK has been updated to [1.10.3](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/dxvk-1.10.3-released/), which improves GPU performance for *Stray*, and vkd3d-proton has been updated to [2.6-1-gc05900da](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/commits/proton-v2.6-support). An update should be available to Proton in your Steam library. See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog#70-4).
