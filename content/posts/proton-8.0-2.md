*Elden Ring* at one point did not [work with Proton 8](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-moves-elden-ring-back-to-proton-7-as-it-has-issues-with-newer-proton/) and had to be used with Proton 7. Well, today's update to Proton 8 now improves compatibility with said title, although the patch notes mention "it can still be finicky."

Most of the updates in Proton 8.0-2 are backported changes from the latest [Proton Experimental](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-experimental-update-4-26-2023/). Several fixes have been added to the Ubisoft Connect overlay, *Trackmania*, *Baldur's Gate 3*, *Divinity: Original Sin*, *Path of Exile*, and *Red Dead Redemption 2*, whether it was a crash, a memory leak, or a black screen.

If you happen to use the EA App, a "temporary workaround" was added to keep it from crashing. Bear in mind the Deck's OSK "may not pop up automatically while using it."

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/releases/tag/proton-8.0-2c).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
