Yesterday's Proton Experimental update mostly focuses on bug fixes. But in addition to game-specific fixes, we've got support for another game: *雀姬 (Mahjong ladies)* -- which, I believe, points to an [anime board game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1084520/_/). Hidraw has been enabled for [Simucube racing wheels](https://simucube.com/steering-wheels/) and [Fanatec pedals](https://fanatec.com/us-en/pedals/). In case you're not aware, hidraw ["provides a raw interface to USB and Bluetooth Human Interface Devices (HIDs)"](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.6/hid/hidraw.html) and is "useful for communicating with non-conformant HID devices which send and receive data in a way that is inconsistent with their report descriptors."

Everything else in this update is related to bug fixes:
- fix *Zeepkist* freezing when using controller
- fix *Microsoft Flight Simulator* crashing during longer flights
- fix *Vampire Survivors* crashing on SteamOS 3.4
- fix *Sackboy: A Big Adventure* failing to start the first time it's launched
- fix *Marvel Snap* not being able connect to online services
- fix video playback speed/stutter in *METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN*
- fix *Halo Infinite* intro video playing in a wrong language

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
