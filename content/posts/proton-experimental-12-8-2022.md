Small update for Proton Experimental is mostly focused on bug fixes. Though we did get a new game to play: [*eXceed - Gun Bullet Children*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/207370/eXceed__Gun_Bullet_Children/). The EA Desktop (the EA App? I'm not sure) should now properly update, ensuring that games can now run, though this may require a few game restarts. *Forza Horizon* (probably both 4 and 5?) should now have the default mapping with the Logitech G920 wheel. And a regression was fixed for the *Star Wars: The Old Republic* launcher "failing to pen."

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
