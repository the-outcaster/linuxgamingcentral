New update shipped to Proton Experimental as of yesterday. *Super Bomberman R* is now playable. If you're planning on playing [*Street Fighter 6*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/sf6-on-deck/) this weekend with the [open beta](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1952120/Street_Fighter_6__Open_Beta/), well, you're in luck, as "various memory leaks during video playback" have been fixed. *Roboquest* gets improved video playback, [*Portal RTX*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/portal-rtx-playable-on-amd/) should now be playable, and *Elder Scrolls Online* should no longer display an "empty/flickering launcher window."

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
