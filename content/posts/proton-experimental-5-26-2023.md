No new games are playable with today's Proton Experimental update, but nearly a dozen bug fixes have made it in. If you're on Deck and play *Last Labyrinth*, there should no longer be a black screen.

A few regressions from [Proton 8](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-8.0-2/) have been fixed, including:
- steering wheel crash fix for *BeamNG.drive*
- flowchart crash fix for *Cafe Stella*
- *Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered* respects controller input
- splash screen crash fix for *Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb*

Along with this are fixes for *Creativerse*, *The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing*, and *Nosferatu: The Warth of Malachi* (with a performance improvement). Finally, the DXVK HUD should now properly display the correct git revision.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
