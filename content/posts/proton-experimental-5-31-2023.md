Two small updates landed for Proton Experimental this week. First, a regression was fixed "that caused DirectX 12 games to not work on Intel GPUs." Second, DXVK has been updated to fix another regression in games like [*Blazblue Centralfication*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/586140/BlazBlue_Centralfiction/), [*Kung-Fu Strike - The Warriors Rise*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/212030/Kung_Fu_Strike__The_Warriors_Rise/), and "many other games." 

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
