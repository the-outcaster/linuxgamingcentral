New update for Proton Experimental has shipped as of yesterday. [*Gunfire: Reborn*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1217060/Gunfire_Reborn/), a roguelike FPS, is now playable.

[NVAPI](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/path-tracing/nvapi/get-started) support has been added to *Dead Space* remake, *Forspoken*, *Forza Horizon 5*, *Hi-Fi Rush*, and many other hits:
- Chernobylite Enhanced Edition
- Dead Space (Remake)
- Forspoken
- Forza Horizon 5
- Hi-Fi Rush
- Marvel's Avengers
- Monster Hunter Rise
- Need For Speed Unbound
- Nioh 2
- Propnight
- Redfall
- Returnal
- Sackboy: A Big Adventure
- SCP: 5K
- Scum
- The Last Of Us Part I
- Watch Dogs Legion

Loading times with *Final Fantasy XIII* have been improved, and the [Steamworks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk) has been updated to 1.57 -- I tried to find the link to the changelog, but I couldn't find it anywhere.

The EA launcher has been fixed once again, as well as the Battle.NET launcher, *Red Dead Redemption 2*, games using the Unity engine, and *Elder Scrolls Online*:
- Fixed Tales of Berseria suffering from screen tearing with vsync turned on while in fullscreen / borderless.
- Fixed EA launcher crashing and removed the previous workaround.
- Fixed Red Dead Redemption 2 taking long time to exit with Alt+F4.
- Fixed Battle.net not starting.
- Fixed cutscenes freezing in Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.
- Fixed multiple Unity titles flickering on the Steam Deck when switching display window options.
- Fixed The Elder Scrolls Online wrongly claiming not enough space.
- Fixed The Elder Scrolls Online launcher showing blank window.
