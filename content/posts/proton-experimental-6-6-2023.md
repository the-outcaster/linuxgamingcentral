Proton Experimental has now added support for the recently released [*Lord of the Rings: Gollum*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1265780/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Gollum/). A few more regressions from Proton 8 have been fixed: *Halo: MCC* no longer has broken menus, and *DJMAX RESPECT V* is playable again.

Along with this, a few fixes have made it in for the Ubisoft Connect invisible window, *Secret of Mana* having flipped videos, *Call of Duty 2* hanging when a map was loaded, and *Creativerse* hanging when exiting from a local game.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
