A new game is now playable with today's update to Proton Experimental: [*CHAOS CODE -NEW SIGN OF CATSTROPHE-*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/536560/CHAOS_CODE_NEW_SIGN_OF_CATASTROPHE/). Great sign if you're a fighting game fan like myself.

Speaking of fighting games, *Street Fighter 6* should no longer report Proton users as using a wired connection. If you're using XWayland and playing *Star Wars: The Old Republic*, there should no longer be buggy camera movement. *Final Fantasy XIII* should no longer have broken input after the main window loses focus. *Dark Souls II*, *Aura: Fate of the Ages*, and *Train Simulator* should still work on setups with "very long library paths."

NVAPI is supported on several more titles, including *Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart*, *Portal: Prelude RTX*, and *Spider-Man: Miles Morales*:
- Alone in the Dark
- Desordre
- Doge Simulator
- Lord of the Rings: Gollum
- Portal Prelude RTX
- Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart
- Remnant 2
- Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened
- Spider-Man: Miles Morales
- Trepang2
