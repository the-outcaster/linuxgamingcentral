Yesterday's update to Proton Experimental is all about bug fixes, although there is one improvement: *Phasmophobia* gets speech recognition. Game stutter for *Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris* has been fixed, and *Overwatch 2* should still be able to recognize controller input after entering an online match. Keyboard input with *Wild Hearts* should no longer register with a delay or get stuck. Aside from this, there have also been fixes for *Escape from Monkey Island*, *Age of Empires II*, and *Microsoft Flight Simulator*.

A few more regressions from Proton 8 have also been fixed in regards to *Gears 5* when logging in and *DOOM Eternal* no longer crashing with ray-tracing enabled on AMDVLK or NVIDIA.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
