Yesterday's Proton Experimental update is all about bug fixes. One new game has been added to the compatibility list: [*Red Tie Runner*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391150/Red_Tie_Runner/), a side-scrolling, 2D platformer.

13 bugs have been fixed, including a few regressions that were fixed from previous updates to Proton Experimental. *Hogwarts Legacy* no longer crashes on Intel GPUs, *Starfield* should now be able to properly save photos in photo mode, *Crysis 2* and *3* get some fixes, the mouse should now work on the main menu in *Death Loop*, and a few other fixes for *Resident Evil 2*, *Remnant: From The Ashes*, *Deep Rock Galatic*, and more.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
