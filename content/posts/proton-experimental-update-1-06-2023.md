Pretty interesting update to Proton Experimental. Today's update adds compatibility with [*Gungrave G.O.R.E*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1630110/Gungrave_GORE/). Force feedback compatibility has been improved with [*BeamNG*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/284160/BeamNGdrive/) and [*Forza Horizon 5*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551360/Forza_Horizon_5/).

As far as bug fixes go, Alt+Tabbing should no longer present any issues for those of you using GNOME 43 or later. Also, [*Life is Strange Remastered*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1265920/Life_is_Strange_Remastered/) should no longer crash after chapter 2.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
