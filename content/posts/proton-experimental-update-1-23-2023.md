Small update out for Proton Experimental. Might be good for Steam Deck users though, as multi-touch support has been 'improved.' How exactly it's been improved, the patch notes don't mention. I guess it's good news for games that require the use of the touchscreen.

And boy, is there a never-ending amount of bug fixes for *Final Fantasy XIV*. The online launcher's "native" scrollbar should no longer be visible all the time.

That's all! See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
