Not a lot to talk about with today's Proton Experimental update, but if you've been wanting to play the newly released [*Forspoken*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/), well, now you can.

In addition, another title is playable: [*Samurai Maiden*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1952250/SAMURAI_MAIDEN/), filled with your favorite waifus holding a katana like a badass.

One other update. If you've been playing [*Tiny Tina's Wonderlands*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286680/Tiny_Tinas_Wonderlands/) on Deck, sleep/resume functionality has been 'improved' in some way.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
