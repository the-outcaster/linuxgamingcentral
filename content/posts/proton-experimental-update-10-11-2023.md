On Wednesday a new update for Proton Experimental shipped out, mostly focused on bug fixes. One new game is now compatible: [*Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/46450/Grotesque_Tactics_Evil_Heroes/).

Steam Deck users will particularly benefit from this update. *Halo Infinite* should no longer crash on SteamOS beta/main. Fullscreen scaling has been fixed on Deck with *MareQuest: An Interactive Tail* and *Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 4*.

Aside from this there's also been fixes for *NASCAR Heat 5*, *Resident Evil 4 Separate Ways* on AMD, *Elite Dangerous*, and *Airborne Kingdom*. *Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2*, which finally made its way to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395210/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_1__2/) less than two weeks ago, should now be able to properly connect to online services.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
