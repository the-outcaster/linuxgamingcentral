Yesterday a new update was pushed out to Proton Experimental. Another game is now playable: [*Burnout Paradise Remastered*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1238080/Burnout_Paradise_Remastered/). Two more flightsticks are now supported "when hidraw is accessible": the [Virpil Constellation ALPHA-R](https://virpil-controls.us.com/vpc-constellation-alpha-prime-r.html) and the [VKB Gladiator NXT EVO](https://www.vkbcontrollers.com/products/gladiator-nxt-evo-space-combat-edition-right-hand).

The rest of the update is bug fixes for *Mighty Switch Force! Collection*, *Forza Horizon 5*, *Cyberpunk 2077* when a DualSense is connected, *Aveyond 4: Shadow of the Mist*, and games that may not properly run on systems with 128+ virtual cores.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
