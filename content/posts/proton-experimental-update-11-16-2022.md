This one slipped under the radar, but better to cover it late rather than never, I guess. Wednesday's update to Proton Experimental enables support for two additional titles: [*NinNinDays2*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1698030/NinNinDays2/) and [*King under the Mountain*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/930230/King_under_the_Mountain/). Additionally, we got fixes for *Halo Infinite*, *Spyro Reignited Trilogy*, *Seperra Core*, *Microsoft Flight Simulator*, *Sin of a Solar Empire: Rebellion*, *Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII* launcher, and *Project CARS 2*:

- Fix Halo Infinite not starting after a recent game update.
- Fix Halo Infinite hanging at multiplayer match start when game window is not focused.
- Fix friend invite to Fireteam lobby not working in Halo Infinite.
- Fix Spyro Reignited Trilogy playing intro video in a wrong language.
- Fix Seperra Core hanging on redistributables installation.
- Fix multiple languages not rendering correctly in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion.
- Fix Korean not being rendered correctly in Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII launcher.
- Fix multiple monitor support in Project Cars 2.
- Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator not starting after a recent game update.
- Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator not displaying live traffic.
