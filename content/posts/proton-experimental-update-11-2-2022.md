Despite today's Proton Experimental update containing only three fixes, they're good fixes nonetheless, especially if you use the new EA App in conjunction with Steam, which is apparently [causing issues](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/ea-begins-swapping-out-origin-for-ea-app-on-steam/). If you were previously getting a blank window, that should no longer be an issue. Fixes have also been added for [*Warhammer: Vermintide 2*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/) and [*The Anacrusis*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1120480/The_Anacrusis/). The former should no longer throw an error when starting the game for the first time, and the latter should now display video when joining a match.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
