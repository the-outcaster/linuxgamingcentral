That EA App sure has become a royal pain, huh? Well, Valve/CodeWeavers are quick to address this dilemma. Flickering on this app should no longer be an issue on the Deck. In addition, [*Quake III: Arena*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2200/Quake_III_Arena/) and *Quake III: Team Arena* have the "weird texture" removed over the menu.

That's all for today's update. See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
