Quite a number of fixes in today's Proton Experimental update. HDR is now available "on capable hardware," including the Steam Deck OLED, for *Mass Effect Legendary Edition* and *Injustice 2*. A few regressions from Proton 8 were fixed, including the cursor desync when toggling fullscreen in *The Binding of Isaac*, and improved load times for *Final Fantasy XIII-2*. More memory leaks have been fixed with the *FFXIV* launcher. Multiplayer in *Dirt Rally* has been fixed.

Some fixes for other titles include *Melty Blood: Type Lumina* multiplayer, *The Last of Us: Part I*, *L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files*, *GTA V* R.E.A.L. mod, and *Injustice 2*.
