So...just when you thought you could run games from Ubisoft Connect on your Deck, only to get a [update that borked Proton compatibility](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/ubisoft-broke-their-games-on-linux-desktop-and-steam-deck/), today's Proton Experimental update fixes the launcher failure.

In fact, not only did the Ubisoft Connect launcher get fixed, but so did 2K's launcher!

That's all for today's update. See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
