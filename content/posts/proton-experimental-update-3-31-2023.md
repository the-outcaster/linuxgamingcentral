- Fix EOS services failing to update for Fall Guys, Returnal and other games. This may require Proton prefix to be re-created.
- Fix recent experimental regression that made THE KING OF FIGHTERS XV start to a black screen.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
