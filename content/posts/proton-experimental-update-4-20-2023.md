Shortly after the release of [Proton 8.0-1](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-8.0-1/) comes an update Proton Experimental -- and this one looks like pretty big. Not only are several titles -- including *Propnight*, the *Bloodrayne Terminal Cut* series, and *Olympia Rising* -- now playable, but many fixes have made it in. Video playback has been fixed in *Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty*, *Nioh: Complete Edition*, and *Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain*. Fixes have also made it in for *DC Universe Online*, *Pentiment*, *Immortals Fenyx Rising*, *Witcher 3*, *Life is Strange Remastered*, and a few others.

Additionally, DXVK and VKD3D-Proton have been updated "to include latest development work", and evidently we have some disk space savings, since the file distribution method has been updated.
