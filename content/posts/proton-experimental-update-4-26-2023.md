New Proton Experimental update has come out that fixes a few regressions with [Proton 8](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-8.0-1/), adds compatibility to a few more titles, fixes a memory leak with the Ubisoft Connect overlay, improves *Elden Ring* compatibility, and a few other fixes. Plus, you are no longer a pirate with *Babo: Invasion*. Apparently the game thought you didn't buy it previously.

The following titles are now playable:
- *Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint*
- *Minecraft Legends*
- *Company of Heroes: Battle of Crete*
- *STRANGER OF PARADISE FINAL FANTASY ORIGIN*

The following regressions from Proton 8 have been fixed:
- *Baldur's Gate 3* no longer launches to a black screen in Vulkan mode.
- *Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition* and *Divinity Original Sin II: Definitive Edition* no longer crash on resolution change.
- *Path of Exile* no longer crashes.
- *GTA V* no longer freezes after each key press.

Improvements:
- Improved *Elden Ring* compatibility compared to Proton 8.0-1. It can still be a bit finicky.
- Added a temporary workaround for EA Launcher crashing. Steam Deck's on-screen keyboard may not pop up automatically while using it.

The following issues have been fixed:
- Fixed Proton Experimental regression causing *Payday 2* to crash on start.
- Fixed memory leak in *Trackmania* and Ubisoft Connect overlay.
- Fixed Madballs in *Babo: Invasion* claiming the game wasn't purchased.
- Fixed *PlanetSide 2* launcher.
- Fixed *Tales of Berseria* screen tearing with Vsync enabled.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
