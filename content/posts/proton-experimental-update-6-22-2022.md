A new update should be available in your Steam client for Proton Experimental, which landed just a few hours ago. Newly playable titles include [*The Rising of the Shield Hero: Relive The Animation*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1146100/The_Rising_of_the_Shield_Hero__Relive_The_Animation/) and [*Paladins*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/444090/Paladins/). *Tekken 7* should no longer crash at launch. Also, several titles, particularly those using the Unity engine, no longer require the MFDXGI hack, including *Rust*, *The Long Dark*, *Monster Train*, *V Rising*, and many others. In other words, video playback in these games have been improved; they shouldn't have any graphical distortion anymore.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
