Small update for Proton Experimental is out that fixes three regressions from the [last update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-experimental-6-24-2023/). First, keyboard input works again in *Football Manager 2023*. Second, there should no longer be any errors between online matches in *Street Fighter 6*. Lastly, *Grounded* can host online games again.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
