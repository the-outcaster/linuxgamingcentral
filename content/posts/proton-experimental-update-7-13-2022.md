Today's update to Proton Experimental is a small one, but a good one for those of you who were recently experiencing issues with either *Assassin's Creed: Origins* or *Warframe*. The former should no longer hang during gameplay after the recent update to the game, and the latter's launcher should no longer be empty (apparently it was an experimental regression). *EDIT: today's update also enables compatibility with Rift, I had overlooked that!*

Other than that, that's it! See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
