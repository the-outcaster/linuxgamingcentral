If Gabe is into something, he really means it. So when he says he's a *Final Fantasy XIV* fan, he's going to get down to business. Because now the regression with said game when using different Proton prefixes should no longer be an issue. And that's the *only* game that was shown any favor with this update. Talk about dedication.

Gabe further showed his love for the RPG by adding a little extra special sauce for you Steam Deck fans out there. The on-screen keyboard should now automatically show up while using the launcher. Ain't that somethin' special?

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).
