New Proton Experimental update has just landed. It's a relatively small update but you'll like it if you happen to be a fan of either [*Unravel 2*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1225570/Unravel_Two/) or [*Zuma's Revenge!*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620/Zumas_Revenge/) Both games are now playable.

In addition, performance for [*HROT*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/824600/HROT/) has been improved. Fixes have been added to [*Civ IV*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3900/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_IV/) and [*OUTRIDERS*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/) -- the former should no longer crash on world creation, and the latter should no longer hang on the black screen when launching the game on the Steam Deck.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog) -- changes in bold are the latest to be added.
