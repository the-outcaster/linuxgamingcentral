The popular ProtonUp-Qt application for easily obtaining the latest version of GE-Proton (as well as GE-Wine for Lutris, etc.) has been updated. These changes come from sonic2kk, the person who made [modding *Sonic Frontiers* possible on Linux with SteamTinkerLaunch](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/sonic-frontiers-modding-guide/). Changes are as follows:
- Fixed downloading DXVK 2.0 for Lutris
- Improvements when installing SteamTinkerLaunch using the ProtonUp-Qt Flatpak
- Reworked the Info dialog
- Improved the Lutris game detection

Get the release on [GitHub](https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/releases/tag/v2.7.6). See my [guide](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton_ge_tutorial/) for getting ProtonUp-Qt set up on your Steam Deck or Linux desktop.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
