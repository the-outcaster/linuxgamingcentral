Got a nice new update for ProtonUp-Qt, the fabulous tool for quickly obtaining the latest version of GE-Proton and other compatibility tools for Steam. Today's update adds Proton-Tkg (Wine Master) as a compatibility tool. Lutris gets vanilla Wine as an added compatibility tool.

The game list now allows you to search and sort your games, and non-Steam games have been added. Speaking of game list, this has also been added for Lutris and Heroic Games Launcher.

Along with the 2.8.0 update is more keyboard shortcuts, a button in the About menu which allows you to add ProtonUp-Qt as a shortcut in your Steam library (great for Deck users), improved startup time, and "various small improvements."

See the full patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/releases/tag/v2.8.0).
