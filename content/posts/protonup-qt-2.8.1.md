Three months after the last release of ProtonUp-Qt comes a new version: 2.8.1. Included in this release is the ability to install GE-Proton, Wine-GE, and D8VK for the Heroic Games Launcher, and Italian translations have been added. More translations can be added via [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/protonup-qt/).

Some other quality-of-life improvements have been baked in. "Internal functions" and the user interface have been overhauled, the gamepad deadzone has been increased, better detection of the Steam root folder and Proton-Tkg releases, and a couple of bug fixes.

Special thanks to **sonic2kk** for this update. See the [patch notes](https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/releases/tag/v2.8.1) for more details.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
