ProtonUp-Qt -- the wonderful application for easily installing the latest version of GE Proton and other Steam compatibility tools -- has received an update. It's been a hot minute since the last release, which was back in August.

Some noteworthy changes:
- you can now add ProtonUp-Qt as a non-Steam shortcut via the About window
- some repos got changed for DXVK-Async and NorthstarProton
- installing Wine-GE now matches the "extract folder name"
- GitHub/GitLab access tokens can be modified in the configuration file
- "various i18n, UI and UX enhancements"

Special thanks to **sonic2kk** and others who have contributed to this release.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/releases/tag/v2.9.1).
