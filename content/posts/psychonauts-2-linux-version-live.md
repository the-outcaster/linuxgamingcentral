True to Double Fine Productions' word, [*Psychonauts 2*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/607080/Psychonauts_2/) is now available natively on Linux. The Mac port coincides with this update, along with two new text languages. The stability for the Strike City checkpoint at the end of the level has also been fixed.

They left a few notes regarding both the Linux and Mac versions. Here's the rundown for the Linux version:
- save file location is in `~/.config/Epic/Psychonauts2/`
- game may crash on launch or when changing the Display settings. They suggest to use alternate display drivers (such as switching between X.org and Wayland), adjusting the in-game resolution scaling, or even moving the Activities bar (found on GNOME) to the bottom. The last fix is a bit of a strange one, but if you're using GNOME and this trick works, well, there you go.

I can't personally test how well the Linux version runs as I don't own the game, so I can't comment on that. Full patch notes are [here](https://steamcommunity.com/games/607080/announcements/detail/3219522887334586228), and you can get the game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/607080/Psychonauts_2/) or [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/psychonauts_2).
