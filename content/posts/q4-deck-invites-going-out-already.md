In the Q4 category while waiting for your Deck, yet somehow you still got an email? It's not a mistake! Valve's Lawrence Yang mentioned on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1561835173800321024):
> Hi all, a few of you may have received an order email for your “Q4 window” Steam Deck reservation today. This wasn’t a mistake! Production has outperformed our estimates, and we’ll be moving more Q4 folks into the Q3 window.

Wow. Production is *scary* fast.

Also, friendly reminder that if you miss your opportunity to order, you can always contact Steam support.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
