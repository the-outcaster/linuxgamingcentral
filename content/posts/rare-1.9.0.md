Rare, the Linux frontend for the Epic Games Store, has now reached a stable 1.9.0 release following a few [release candidates](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/rare-1.9.0-rc-released/). Codenamed "Magnolia Catnip," this update contains *over 50 pull requests* and as a result packs quite a few new features, UI enhancements, and bug fixes. Here's just a few of the changes:
- games are now run as a second process; this will keep them running should Rare close
- desktop shortcuts are now a thing
- kinetic scrolling for touch devices (Steam Deck, anyone?)
- MangoHUD customizations
- optimizations, bug fixes, and support for "poetry"

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/Dummerle/Rare/releases/tag/1.9.0). Grab the AppImage or .deb file from there, install it via the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rare) if you're on Arch, or get the [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.dummerle.rare) if you're on Steam Deck.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
