While Sony has been known to bring some of their original IPs over to Steam, I was *not* expecting any title from the *Ratchet & Clank* series to come over to PC. Well, it looks like this will be happening, and very soon at that. To top it off, it's the latest game in the series: *Rift Apart*.

> Go dimension-hopping with Ratchet and Clank as they venture onto a PC near you for the very first time. Help them take on an evil emperor from another reality as you jump between action-packed worlds and beyond.

Looks like the PC port will have some nice additions:
- ultra-wide support (21:9, 32:9, 48:9)
- triple monitor support
- uncapped framerate
- ray-traced reflections and shadows
- DLSS 3/FSR 2/Intel XeSS
- DualSense haptic feedback/dynamic trigger support (in wired mode)
- keyboard and mouse controls

There may very well be Steam Deck support with the mention of "portable PC gaming devices":
> Choose from a wide variety of graphics quality options to tailor to a wide range of devices, all the way from high-end PCs to portable PC gaming devices.

And guess what? It won't carry the $70 price tag!

I'm looking forward to this. *Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart* will be available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1895880/Ratchet__Clank_Rift_Apart/) for $60 later this summer on July 26th.
