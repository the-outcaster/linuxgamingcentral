Less than a month after the arrival of the point & click adventure *Return to Monkey Island*, the game now has native Linux support. This is available as a public beta.

The [Tweet](https://twitter.com/grumpygamer/status/1580990722580566018) that Ron Gilbert sent out contains a link to the instructions on how to opt-in to the beta...but the link to the guide is dead if you're not logged into Steam and you have the game in your account. I would imagine it requires opting into a beta branch and entering a password. As I don't own the game I can't confirm...but it's great news nonetheless.

Check out the game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060130/Return_to_Monkey_Island/). It's been met with very positive reviews.
