Forum user Jrelvas had [reported](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528) *Roblox* using a new 64-bit client that has Byfron implemented. With this new client, Wine users are met with the message, "Wine is not supported." Think you can use a VM? Think again -- "You have been kicked due to unexpected client behavior." The original poster thought the lack of Wine was unintentional.

But MrEaker from the *Roblox* staff replied:
> Unfortunately this block was intentional. With the Windows 64-bit client launch **we made the conscious decision to block the use of Wine.** We came to this decision due to a combination of security and compatibility concerns. As a Linux user I am sure you understand the challenges of the Windows ecosystem. Wine is not officially supported but we are committed to working towards compatibility where possible. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a specific timeline for this support. However, I assure you that it remains a priority for our team.

Naturally, the subsequent posts following that response shows frustration and sadness. This not only prevents Linux desktop users from playing the game; anyone who uses a Steam Deck also won't be able to run it. MrEaker mentioned "we are committed to working towards compatibility where possible," but another person from the *Roblox* staff more recently [said](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/proper-support-for-the-linux-platform/56544/87), "From a technical and philosophical perspective, it would be a wonderful thing to do. But our first responsibility is to our overall community, and the opportunity cost of supporting a Linux client is far, far too high to justify."

Guess you'll have to look into alternatives.
