YouTuber The Phawx today went on camera to reveal the details behind the [GPD Win Mini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZJ6W-gbK7c), which, according to him, "will not allow the [ROG Ally](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/asus-cant-compete-against-steam-deck/) to hog the spotlight for themselves." So, instead of handheld PC manufacturers going up against the Steam Deck, they're now fighting with the Deck competitors. Gamepad Digital has been in the PC handheld market for a long time, being the creators of the [Win 4](https://www.gpd.hk/gpdwin4) and the [Win Max 2](https://www.gpd.hk/gpdwinmax2).

Here's some of the details The Phawx has revealed regarding the GPD Win Mini:
- "a bit larger than the GPD Win 2" and upgrades the screen to 7", 1080p, with a refresh rate of 120 Hz
- the screen may support black frame insertion (BFI), although this hasn't been confirmed 
- there will be two different configurations: one with a [7440U, the other with a 7840U](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-7000-series). The latter "has the absolute best chip possible" and would be the smallest x86-based handheld out there
- it will have an [OCuLink current connector](https://www.delock.com/infothek/OCuLink/oculink_e.html). Unlike the ROG Ally, which is using a proprietary connection for connecting external devices, the Win Mini will have an open standard OCuLink connector for connecting external GPUs. It will also support Thunderbolt 3 via USB 4
- built-in gyro, clickable thumbsticks, rumble motors, backlit keyboard

He tells the viewer to temper their expectations when it comes to running games at 120 FPS:
> Even the most high-end version will have difficulty running games trying to meet the demand of the screen itself...instead, know that it wlll be very easy to use frame capping to instantly switch between 40 and 60fps without having to
worry about forcing the screen to a different frequency.

To picture the size of the GPD Win Mini, the blue area on the back of the Deck pictured here is what the dimensions of the device are. And yet, it will have "the same or better chip than the ROG Ally" and a similar screen.

Price? The Phawx says "the Indiegogo crowdfunding price will start **at around $700**." He mentions the pricing will likely get updated as we get closer to the Indiegogo campaign, which is scheduled for June. Whether "updated" means for the better or worse, I'm not sure.

No word on RAM, storage, or battery capacity. With such a small device I can't imagine they'll be able to pack anything larger than a 40 Wh battery.

What are your thoughts on this? Would you rather pick up a Win Mini over the ROG Ally or vice-versa? Do you think the Win Mini actually has a chance?
