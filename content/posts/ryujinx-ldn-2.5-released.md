Did you know you can play online multiplayer with Nintendo Switch games on Linux? It's possible thanks to Ryujinx's LDN build.

Today the LDN build got an [update](https://www.patreon.com/posts/ldn-2-5-vulkan-70757628) that now enables Vulkan. This means improved performance on AMD and Intel, and all GPU vendors "will enjoy drastically reduced shader compilation stuttering!"

Mind you, the last time we saw an update to LDN was back in November, so all the changes made to the main branch since then have made it over to the new 2.5 build, including stability improvements and compatibility with more games.

There's a Linux build available on their [Patreon post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/ldn-2-5-vulkan-70757628). You don't need to pledge your support; the download is free for everyone.

I can't wait to try this on Deck! *Mario Kart 8* anyone?
