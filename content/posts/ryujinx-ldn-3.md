I can't help but chuckle. The newly released *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet* is apparently suffering from [framerate issues](https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/23462310/pokemon-scarlet-violet-performance-issues-technical-frame-rate).

A first-party game. Having framerate issues on native hardware.

Good thing we've got emulation. Ryujinx is a great choice. In fact, if you want to play online multiplayer on Linux/Windows with *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, it's possible thanks to the LDN build. We've got quite a few goodies in store here with the new 3.0 update. We've got improved performance, particularly with the new *Pokémon* game; *Splatoon 3* is now playable on AMD GPUs; and interconnectivity with Linux/Windows and actual Nintendo Switch consoles that have custom firmware is now possible.

Key features are as follows:
- `ldn_mitm` support for connectivity with CFW Nintendo Switch consoles.
- *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet* no longer have a white/yellow filter in gameplay.
- *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet* will have greatly improved performance.
- *Splatoon 3* is now playable on AMD GPUs on Windows and Linux.
- *Splatoon 3* scoring and other gameplay elements are no longer affected by resolution scaling.
- *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* no longer requires a save file to avoid crashing on the intro.
- *Pokémon Sword & Shield* have improved performance when using Vulkan.
- General performance and stability improvements for most other titles.

Additionally, if you want, you can use Ryujinx's new Avalonia UI:

Awesome if you want an interface that's a little more modern-looking.
