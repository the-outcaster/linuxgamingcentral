Yesterday a new [blog post](https://blog.ryujinx.org/progress-report-march-2022/) was submitted on the Ryujinx website. I wanted to extract some of the highlights of this post.

To start things off, graphics are now more "stable" on OpenGL with Intel and AMD GPUs. Though games like *Pok√©mon Legends Arceus* displayed just fine with Ryujinx's Vulkan build, previously the game would look horrendous:

That's no longer the case:

*Game Builder Garage* and *WarioWare: Get it Together!* had a few GPU regressions fixed. Several games now boot much faster due to expanded buffers, and *Super Mario Galaxy* now incorporates the starbit interactions.

Sometimes the viewport while recording a game looked a bit shuffled. This should no longer be the case. Texture corruption is no longer present in certain titles, including *Cartoon Network: Battle Crashers* and *Snack World*.

As for the **CPU**, several improvements were made to the recompiler. For **audio**, a bug was fixed in the renderer, therefore allowing games like *Mononoke Slashdown* and *Paper Mario: The Origami King* to load and no longer crash.

*Splatoon 2* and *Fire Emblem: Three Houses* had a slowdown during certain areas...when checking the time. This has now been fixed.

There's plenty of other small details in the [post](https://blog.ryujinx.org/progress-report-march-2022/); have a read if you want the full story including how the fixes were implemented.
