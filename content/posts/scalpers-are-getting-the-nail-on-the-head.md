Well, this is a relief to see.

Seems like NVIDIA themselves are the scalpers -- rather than the ones who greedily buy them in bulk and sell them at three or four times the price -- at least when it comes to the 4080/4090. See, the price of the 4080 is so expensive that it hasn't appealed to that many people. As a result, scalpers who bought these cards, thinking that people were going to be desperate enough to scoop them up, are regretting their purchases. They've been [forced to sell them at MSRP or even lower](https://www.techspot.com/news/96837-scalpers-struggle-sell-rtx-4080-above-msrp-but.html).

"Still very hard to get these cards." Yeah, what a load of BS.

But here's where it hits them hard: some of these scalpers, depending on where they bought the card, can't even return it for a refund. [Newegg](https://www.hardwaretimes.com/newegg-is-no-longer-accepting-refunds-for-the-nvidia-rtx-4080-to-tackle-scalpers/) is an example where they're not taking refunds. Thanks, Newegg.

With AMD's upcoming 6900 XT/XTX selling at a cheaper price, it makes both NVIDIA and scalpers look even more stupid.
