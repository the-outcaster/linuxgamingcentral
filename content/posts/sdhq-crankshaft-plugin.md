Though being able to check ProtonDB ratings at a glance on Deck is a useful feature to have with [Crankshaft](https://crankshaft.space), you can now get more detailed reports on various games, thanks to the [Steam Deck HQ plugin](https://github.com/shelbykleindesign/steamdeckhq-crankshaft-plugin). As you might have guessed by the name, the compatibility details are extracted from the reviews posted on [Steam Deck HQ](https://steamdeckhq.com).

Check out the [guide](https://steamdeckhq.com/tips-and-guides/crankshaft-a-steam-deck-plugin/) from them on how to get Crankshaft installed on the Deck. After this is installed you can then install the Steam Deck HQ Ratings plugin. Now, if there is a review available for a particular game, you can tap the "SDHQ Rating" box that appears to the right side of the boxart. The Deck's web browser will open up and will be directed to the review of the game on SDHQ. Each game is broken into three different sections: settings, review, and game info. As an example, here is the review for *Guilty Gear -Strive-*:

And here is the settings for *Tunic*:

This really couldn't be more convenient for checking recommended settings! Only caveat is the page has to be scrolled with the touchscreen; buttons don't work.

Props to the SDHQ team for doing this. Previously you would have to open up your web browser, whether it be on desktop or on Desktop Mode on Deck, navigate to the site, then selecting the review. Now this plugin makes things much more convenient. Just a tap of a button if the review is available, and you'll be taken straight to the review. Plus, the plugin is open-source, so if you have familiarity with TypeScript, you can add enhancements if you like!
