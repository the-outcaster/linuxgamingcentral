Just when you thought you could play Capcom's latest fighter without any sort of anti-tamper involved, the Steam store page for *Street Fighter 6* now lists Denuvo DRM. Although, this behavior has been pretty typical of Capcom's PC releases, so it shouldn't come as much of a surprise.

Prior to May 30th, if you had visited the Steam store page, the DRM wasn't listed. However, if we head over to [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/1364780/history/?changeid=U:38727050), it looks like Denuvo got added on this date, and the store page has been updated appropriately.

*Street Fighter 6* launches tomorrow on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364780/Street_Fighter_6/) for $60.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
