A few days ago *Street Fighter 6* was available as a demo on PlayStation consoles. Well, great news for Deckers and PC gamers alike: the same demo is [now available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364780/view/3690179962069389427). Gameplay footage is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/TXo76DXL_ds).

But beware, it's gonna leave a hole in your SSD's "wallet". It takes up **16.7 GB** of space.

I briefly played the game on Deck. Though it's not a requirement, I'd recommend using GE-Proton to ensure better video compatibility. The game runs fine with vanilla Proton 8, but you'll get that missing media codec image for the intro video.

Second, **don't use anything higher than Normal graphics settings**. Even with the preset set to Normal, there are going to be frame dips here and there in the Story Mode, and certain maps. I recommend setting the preset to Low, and then adjusting the max framerate to 60 from the in-game Options menu; by default on Low the max FPS is set to 30. As this is obviously a fighting game, I don't recommend using a framerate any lower than 60 FPS.

Third, I wouldn't even bother adjusting the TDP or GPU clock speed. The game is pretty demanding, and will consume around 18 W on average. Unfortunately based on my testing it is *not* possible to make use of FSR and lowering the game resolution; you're locked to 1280 x 720 and can't adjust this. There isn't even a fullscreen option; just Windowed or Borderless Windowed options. If the game was using Unreal Engine like its predecessor, there might be a "hack" for forcing a lower resolution, but since *SF6* is using Capcom's proprietary RE Engine, I'm not aware of any workarounds for the time being.

That being said, I would give *SF6* a "Playable" Steam Deck rating. You can definitely play it, but keep the graphics settings to Low or Lowest. I'm hoping by the time the full game launches June 2 there will be a "fullscreen" option and resolution support that's lower than 1280 x 720.
