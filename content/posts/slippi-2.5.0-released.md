We haven't seen an update to Slippi since February. But today we finally got one! New features include desync detection and [m-ex](https://github.com/akaneia/m-ex) support (allows expansion of content). The modifier key should now work with keyboard setups, the performance warning is now more clear, and the quickchat feature has been refactored to C rather than ASM. One particular bug fix for Linux users is that building the project (or using it) on newer systems with ffmpeg 5 should now work!

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/project-slippi/Ishiiruka/releases/tag/v2.5.0). Special thanks to **JLaferri, UnclePunch, rapito, NikhilNarayana, mkrasnitski, and pdeblois** for making this release possible!
