With the Slippi Launcher, it is now possible to configure chat messages under the "Chat" tab in General Settings. There are 16 different messages to choose from. Tier 1 subs get access to eight "premium" messages. Tier 2 and above get access to 16.

Concerning bug fixes, it should now be possible to build Slippi on Arch Linux, and on Mac OS, chat in widescreen and special characters in chat should display properly.

**Support for Ubuntu 18.04 is now deprecated** since "Github effectively no longer provides CI/CD on 18.04." Finally, the Mac OS "User" folder has been moved to Application Support since it's required on Ventura and makes Dolphin easier to update.

"Too good."

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/project-slippi/Ishiiruka/releases/tag/v3.1.0). If you want to get Slippi set up on Linux/Steam Deck, check out [my](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/slippi_guide/) [guides](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-and-melee/).
