Slippi version 3.0.0 is out. This release has early support for ranked matchmaking! For the time being, **ranked matchmaking requires a subscription**, the minimum of which will set you back at $5/month. [Manage your Slippi account](https://slippi.gg/manage) and choose your subscription tier. After that you'll need to agree to the Terms of Service with the Slippi Launcher. Ranked matchmaking will be free *after* it comes out of early access. You can also check the [leaderboards](https://slippi.gg/leaderboards).

When you face an opponent in ranked, it's the best of three. You'll automatically disconnect from them after two wins. It's kind of weird how the stage selection process works, depending on whether you win or you lose, but I do have a [video](https://youtu.be/-yukqW69b0I) if you'd like to see ranked in action.

The Windows version of Slippi also got signed for "fewer antivirus freakouts." Good thing we're on Linux.
