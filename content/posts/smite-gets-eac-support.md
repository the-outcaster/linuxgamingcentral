Great news for MOBA fans. *SMITE* will be getting Linux/Steam Deck support with the [10.6 update](https://www.smitegame.com/news/the-season-of-souls-10-6-update-notes/):
> *SMITE* will now run on Linux systems â€“ special thanks to the *SMITE* community for helping with this. A group of players in the r/smite discord made a big impact on this change.

While it mentions Linux specifically, I would assume that by extension this also means support for the Steam Deck. The EAC the game uses will now support these platforms.

Aside from that there are a *ton* of other features coming to the update, including new skins, UI fixes, adjusted rules for various game modes, adjusted characters, etc. See the [patch notes](https://www.smitegame.com/news/the-season-of-souls-10-6-update-notes/) for more info.

*SMITE* is free-to-play on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/386360/SMITE/).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
