Well, here comes a shocker.

It seems like Nintendo has finally given up the battle. After DMCA-ing the crap out of YouTubers who post videos of the Steam Deck emulating Nintendo Switch games, as well as shutting down unofficial, fan-made projects that make use of their IP, I think Nintendo is *finally* giving their fans what they want: a proper port of one of their first-party titles on a platform other than their own. Looks like it was done in-house by Nintendo themselves.

I would have thought that they were going to have their own launcher to play this game, but what took me by surprise is they put *Super Mario Odyssey* on Steam. What's even more shocking is that in addition to Windows, there's a Mac and a Linux version standing right alongside the release.

No way. No way this is happening!

So I bought the game, played it on Arch, and low and behold, it's working *great*, and it seems the Linux version is using Vulkan as the graphics API:

It's only using about 2 GB of VRAM and less than 8 GB RAM at 1440p resolution. Don't even need to use GameMode to get this to run at a crisp 60 FPS with my GTX 1660 Super!

One thing they didn't update was the controller icons. So, although you could use a Xbox or PlayStation controller, the icons in-game are still for the Nintendo Switch Pro controller. They probably don't want to acknowledge the other console manufacturers out there.

I really wonder why they did this. Maybe it has to do with the fact that Valve is releasing [the *Portal* series to the Switch this year](https://boilingsteam.com/portal-series-coming-to-nintendo-switch-but-why/)? If Valve is bringing such a great IP to the Big N's platform, perhaps Nintendo wanted to return the favor by releasing *Super Mario Odyssey* on Steam as a sort of "testing" grounds to see how well sales do. It's like they're taking notes from Sony and gradually releasing first-party games to PC a few years after their console exclusivity. And I really think *Super Mario Odyssey* was a good choice, as it's [one of the top ten best-selling Switch games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_Nintendo_Switch_video_games).

Want to try it out yourself? Head over to the [Steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/641789/Super_Mario_Odyssey/)!
