New update is out for [*Sonic Frontiers*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/sonic-frontiers-review/). It adds:
- photo mode
- juke box -- play any of the 53 songs available in the game after collecting the music notes
- Cyber Space challenge mode -- time-attack against seven of the Cyber Space levels
- battle rush -- "several rounds against increasingly tough enemies, guardians, and Titans"

The update also adds some much-needed quality-of-life improvements:
- power boost/starfall slot machine can now be toggled on or off
- Cyber Space levels can be restarted mid-level
- you can upgrade Sonic with multiple Koco at a time, rather than just going through one upgrade at a time

There will be two more updates coming later this year, so there's still more to look forward to! See the full patch notes on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1237320/view/3719449637214768385?l=english).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
