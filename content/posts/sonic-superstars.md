Blending 2D and 3D worlds has been something that Sega has tried often -- since *Sonic Generations* in 2012. This is their third attempt with [*Sonic Superstars*](https://sonicsuperstars.com/) -- recently revealed during the [Summer Game Fest](https://www.polygon.com/23752958/summer-game-fest-announcements-trailers-2023) -- coming to Steam later this fall.

Still, it looks fairly interesting. Sonic returns to the 2D side-scrolling formula, while retaining his classic, slightly chubbier form, but the graphics are in 3D. Seems like a spiritual successor to *Sonic the Hedgehog 4*.

Playable characters besides Sonic include Tails, Knuckles, Amy, and Fang the Sniper, who came from *Sonic the Hedgehog: Triple Trouble* and *Sonic the Fighters*. New abilities can be retrieved by collecting Chaos Emeralds -- you'll notice in one part of the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3g-62NNoUs) the characters become voxelated squids.

*Sonic Superstars* is coming to Steam and consoles in Fall 2023.
