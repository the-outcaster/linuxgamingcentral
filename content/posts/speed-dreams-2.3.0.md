If you're into motorsports, you might like [Speed Dreams](https://www.speed-dreams.net/en/). Per the description on the official website:
> Speed Dreams is a Motorsport Simulator featuring high-quality 3D graphics and an accurate physics engine, all targeting maximum realism...It mainly aims to implement exciting new features, cars, tracks and AI opponents to make a more enjoyable game for the player, while constantly pushing forward visual and physics realism.

It's also open-source under the GPLv2 license and developed in C/C++. Downloads are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac.

Just recently version 2.3.0 was released. This contains "many months of hard work" and "more than a thousand commits." Hope the devs don't mind if I just do a copypasta of the patch notes, but basically, this update contains new cars, a new track, tire temp and degradation, new menu sound effects, and just so many other things:
- Added tire temperature and degradation in Supercars, 67GP, MPA11 and MPA12 categories, in addition to the existing MP1.
- New widgets for the HUD in OSG, such as tires, forces, delta or controls, in addition to the existing ones.
- New sounds in the game menus, as well as in the gear shift, tire skid or some car engines.
- New options in sound menu, and In-game volume adjustment.
- New interiors and animated drivers in some Supercars models, like the Boxer 96, Cavallo 360, FMC GT4, and the Kanagawa Z35 GT-S.
- Now is possible to change the car setup inside the game. Also you can also choose the initial fuel and steering wheel rotation degrees displayed on the game screen.
- New cars like the Mango MS7 and the Murasama 37A, both in the "1967 Grand Prix" category
- New cars and robots in MPA12 category: Deckard and Spirit added to existing Murasama cars
- New track based on the Melbourne circuit.
- Added lots of new skins for various cars, especially in the LS-GT1 category
- A huge work on trackeditor with tons of new features, corrections and optimizations
- Added temperature in wheel widget in SSG graphic engine.
- Lots of fixes and optimizations on the tire model. Now is more easy to get the tires on optimal temp
- Lots of new robots in many categories
- Better braking on shadow and dandroid robots
- Better support for multi-display systems.
- New Windows complete installer. All the official contents of the game in a single file.
- Lots of Fixes, optimizations and of course, code cleanup
