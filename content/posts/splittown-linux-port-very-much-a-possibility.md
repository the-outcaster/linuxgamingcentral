Remember that point-and-click game [*Splittown*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/splittown-upcoming-point-n-click/) that I had talked about a couple of months ago? The Linux port of that game is becoming more and more of a reality.

Someone had asked in the [Steam forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2117400/discussions/0/3321988498676426081/?tscn=1662278839) what the status is as far as Linux support. A developer of the game responded:

> We're using Visionaire Studio, which supports Linux porting, so **it's very much a possibility**, but we haven't explored that very much as of yet, since we're still putting the game together.

The developer further goes on to mention that they would "love to hear from all the Linux users who are interested in the game so that we can see how much interest there is." They're all for it, provided "it's not a big time investment." So, if you'd like to see this game come natively to Linux, voice your support there in the Steam forum.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
