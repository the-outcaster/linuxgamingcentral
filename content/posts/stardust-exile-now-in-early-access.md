The era of space colonization has begun for humanity, but the era of war never ended. Your faction, like many others before, wanted to achieve peace by conquering the cradle of humanity, the Solar System. But it failed and was exiled to the periphery of the Milky Way. Centuries have passed but the war was never forgotten. Now as you become an expansionist empire again, you try to make your way to the Solar System again, and end your exile.

*Stardust Exile* is a RTS game set in space. It was created by just a single developer and released on Steam in Early Access on February 17th, 2023. The description is as follows:
> Players will be able to change the name of stars and planets they find. They can also create their own spaceship designs with an in-game procedural ship generator, and design their fleet to be different from all other players in-game.

It has over *200 billion* star systems that are generated "based on currently known exoplanets and stars data" while the rest is procedurally-generated. The main objective is to "return to the Solar System and end your exile" by building a space fleet with defensive units, attack units, and industrial units.

Trailer available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OePyaxBLLlc). *Stardust Exile* is available natively on Linux! Get it on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858900/Stardust_Exile/) for $20.
