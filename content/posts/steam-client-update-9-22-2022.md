As if it wasn't enough for a [Steam Deck/SteamOS update today](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steamos-beta-and-steam-deck-client-beta-9-22-2022/), Valve also pushed an update to the Steam desktop client. Again, the list of patch notes is far too much to cover here, but here are some of the highlights:
- a Games to Play Together section has been added with your friends who have the same games in common
- the "updated purchase approval dialog" has been added specifically to Linux and Mac OS
- reduced network usage on startup
- CEF has been updated to [85.0.4183.121](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/85.0.4183.121)
- capture performance has been "greatly improved" in games with the Vulkan backend
- black screen when streaming to a Linux device should no longer be an issue
- support for a few additional gamepads, including third-party joycons
- and many, *many* fixes
