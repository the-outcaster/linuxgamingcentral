Steam Deck gets a new beta client update with fixes for patch notes, the OSK, joystick deadzone, and more. Users should no longer get the "Maximum number of clients reached" message. Patch notes can now be viewed on the Downloads page. OSK can now be activated in New BPM and the Steam window isn't focused.

Patch notes are as follows:

**General**
- fixed regression causing "Maximum number of clients reached" issue
- fixed issue opting in to some game beta branches
- fixed Patch Notes button on Downloads page entries
- allow onscreen keyboard to be activated while in New Big Picture Mode and Steam window is not focused
- fixed some issues where onscreen keyboard and controller configurator windows could not be reactivated after closing

**Steam Input**
- fixed issue w/ Joystick Deadzone visualization not updating

Patch notes can also be read on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/5662747178710102498).
