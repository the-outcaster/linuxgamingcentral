*Note: since Valve is copy/pasting the patch notes from the desktop client, some of these patch notes may NOT be for the Steam Deck! I am unable to confirm since I am on stable.*

Patch notes can also be read on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3635002625404567686).

**General**
- Added ability to move the standalone & overlay keyboard. The keyboard will cycle through a set of positions.
- Fixed controller input in the windowed version of the controller configurator
- Added mouse buttons to the events that will skip the start-up movie

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
