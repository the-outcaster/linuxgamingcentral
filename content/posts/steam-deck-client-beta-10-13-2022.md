A new Deck client update has shipped to the Beta and Preview branches. Notable additions to this update are startup videos can now be longer than 10 seconds, the QAM going to the notifications tab when there's a new message from a friend, and controller-specific glyphs have been added to the Lock Screen. Patch notes are as follows:

**General:**

- The Quick Access Menu will now open to the notifications tab when you have new friend chat messages, game invites, or voice chat invites
- Notifications for Game Invites in the Quick Access Menu now have an option in the footer to accept them without having to navigate to the chat window
- Fixed an issue where Steam group chats with long names or descriptions could cause break the layout of the chat screen
- Increase boot animation max length from 10 seconds to 30 seconds
- Added controller-specific glyphs on the Lock screen
- Fixed an issue on the Lock screen where you'd have to dismiss the On-Screen Keyboard manually if you slept the device while it was up
- Fixed invoking the On-Screen-Keyboard while already in a fullscreen keyboard input scenario causing bad behavior.

**Steam Input:**
- Fixed an issue with editing command settings from inside the virtual menu screen

Check out my [guide](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/randomize-deck-startup-videos-guide/) on how to customize your Deck bootloader, as well as randomize what gets played.

Since it wasn't worth covering in a separate post, I decided to combine this with the **new Proton Experimental update** that just shipped today. *Halo Infinite* should no longer crash without Internet, and a fix was added for *Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered* displaying an outdated AMD driver dialog.

See the patch notes for the Deck client update on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/6186282400389030370), and the patch notes for Proton Experimental on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
