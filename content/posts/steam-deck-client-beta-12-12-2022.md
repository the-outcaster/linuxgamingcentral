Yet another update slipped my mind. This came out yesterday. The [Armor-X Pro pad](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=armor-x+pro+gamepad&t=brave&iax=images&ia=images) in PS4 mode is now supported, and several fixes have made it in on desktop and in general. [Patch notes](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3637250052888201563?l=english) are as follows:

**General**
- Fixed keyboard re-opening incorrectly on game exit
- Added support for the Armor-X Pro gamepad in PS4 mode
- Fixed long delay at startup when the Razer Huntsman Elite keyboard is plugged in
- Fixed the Logitech G29 controller showing up as a gamepad instead of a wheel

**Desktop Mode**
- Fixed overlay scaling when resizing game window in new Big Picture Mode
- Fixed crash when taking screenshots through the overlay

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
