More, upon more, upon *more* fixes for the Steam Deck. This time around, the Steam store should no longer have any gamepad focus issues, and footer buttons should properly be displayed. In Desktop Mode, the login interface got some minor layout fixes. It shouldn't stretch past the bottom of the window. Context menus should now work after closing the Update news dialog. Subbed workshop items should properly display now when "there were thousands of them."

The Steam controller got a fix where the joystick had "unintended input" while using Steam button chords.

On top of this, if you're on the preview branch, SteamOS 3.4 got a ["Tamed Keys"](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5201125680683952817?l=english) update. Dismissing the OSK should no longer crash the graphics driver in Desktop Mode.

See the patch notes on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5201125680681076015?l=english).
