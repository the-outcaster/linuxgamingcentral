When browsing controller profiles on the Deck, you can now search for them with today's (or yesterday's?) [Deck client update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5201125680699102974?l=english) (on beta and preview branches). Your library should now properly load if you have Family View enabled. More buttons have been added to the list of inputs "that skip the BPM/Deck start up animations." A regression was fixed regarding Yaw and Roll combined sliders. Negative contribution from either one is now respected.

Also, if you're on the Preview branch, you should have got an [update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5201125680698748299?l=english) that "fixed an audio driver bug that could lead to on-board audio crackling in some situations." Stable branch users also got an [update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5201125680687903832?l=english) that fixes a regression for the Steam library view in Desktop Mode and the lockscreen PIN reset sequence. Also, gamepad focus and footer buttons in the Steam store should now properly work.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
