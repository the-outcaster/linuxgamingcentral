Patch notes can also be read on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3635002625415252852).  

**General**
- Fixed onscreen keyboard not visible in-game when opened with gamepad

**Steam Input**
- Gyro Calibration UI: Gyro rotation readings are displayed to help diagnose drift issues.
- Autocalibration of Gyro Drift has been reworked. After the initial calibration setting down a controller on a stable surface silently recalculates drift compensation within a few seconds. Movement Threshold values can be manually tweaked - useful if you notice drift re-appear when the controller is in hand.

**Deck Desktop**
- Fixed Steam Chat window scaling
- Fixed onscreen keyboard windows refusing to close
- Fixed regression where some Remote Play Together dialogs no longer worked

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
