New Deck client update (beta) mostly focuses on bug fixes. It improves the login time for users with big game libraries. DPI scaling should now be proper on initial load, and the OSK in Desktop Mode should be properly resized. All of this and more:
- Improved login times for users with large libraries
- Fixed links to store/discussions/etc in the Library
- Fixed crash when trying to view emojis in virtual keyboard in desktop mode
- Fixed improper DPI scaling on initial load
- Decreased load time of virtual keyboard and standalone controller configurator in desktop mode after the first time
- Properly resize virtual keyboard in desktop mode
- Streamlined joining a voice chat in groups without multiple voice chat channels. The footer button will now directly join or create a temporary channel rather than go to the voice chat management dialog
