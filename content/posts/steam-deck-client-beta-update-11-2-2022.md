Full patch notes are as follows:
- Fixed some instances were focus was lost
- More improvements to reduce login time for users with large libraries
- Fixed issue where spotlighted games in the What's New section could not be interacted with
- Fixed some issues with trackpad typing
- Updated Steam Controller LB and RB button images
- Fixed Main Menu not adjusting size/position when adjusting UI scale
- Fixed recently exported Controller Layout Templates not showing up in the Layout Browser
