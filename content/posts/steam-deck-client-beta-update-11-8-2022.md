I must have missed this yesterday. We have a new Deck client update (beta) that mostly focuses on bug fixes for mailto links, third-party Switch controller glyphs, offline mode, and a few others. Patch notes are as follows:
- Added error dialog for when the user clicks on a mailto link
- Set scale for startup movies so that the top and bottom of the movie are cropped for 16:9 aspect ratio in docked mode
- Fixed issue in desktop mode that sometimes made it difficult to drag the Friends List
- Fixed glyphs for third party Nintendo Switch controllers while streaming
- Fixed inaccurate location of context menus for the Friends List in desktop mode
- Fixed a bug that could prevent exiting offline mode in the same session where the client entered offline mode

Patch notes can also be read on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3425577645381338804).
