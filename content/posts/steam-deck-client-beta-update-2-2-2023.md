Judging from some of these patch notes, it looks like Valve is *again* doing the copypasta business with their desktop Steam client, so if you don't see these patches in action on Deck, you'll know why. (I'm on the stable branch so I can't confirm.)

**General**
- The Virtual Keyboard in the Overlay now remembers its last position
- Fixed Chord Hint Screen remaining shown after holding the guide button to turn off a controller in some scenarios

**Steam Input**
- Fixed some inputs not showing up for the Steam Link App Touchscreen controller

**Desktop**
- Fixed Big Picture Mode window not re-opening from double-clicking or selecting system tray menu options
- Fixed Big Picture Mode window not displaying properly due to web GPU acceleration being disabled
- Added F11 as a hotkey to toggle between windowed and fullscreen
- Added alt-enter as a hotkey to exit Big Picture Mode
- Fixed issue where exiting Big Picture Mode would log out of Steam Chat
- Report a Bug in the Quick Access menu now links to the Big Picture discussions instead of the Steam Deck discussions
- Removed UI that prompted users if they wanted to participate in the Steam Deck Verified program when in normal BPM
