Small update for the Steam Deck has rolled out today as beta, primarily focusing on bug fixes. Patch notes are as follows:
```
- Fixed a bug where some flatpak applications (like Edge) couldn't successfully quit
- Fixed some issues with claiming Steam Deck digital rewards
- Updated keyboard behavior for improved fast typing on trackpad and touchscreen. (pressing a key while holding another key will now commit the held key instead of waiting for first to release)
```

Note that this is a *beta* client update and, as such, you will need to be opted into the **Beta** or **Preview** update branch in System Settings in order to download it.
