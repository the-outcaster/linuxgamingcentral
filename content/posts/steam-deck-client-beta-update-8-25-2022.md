Today's beta Deck client update mostly focuses on bug fixes, plus the styling of command names in Steam Input has been improved. Patch notes are as [follows](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3254434504248152987):

**General**
- Fixed scrolling on home recommended screen due to discovery queue
- Fixed issue where What's New section was not populated properly

**Steam Input**

- Fix action set layers not carrying through Gamepad triggers outputs from button bindings

In case you haven't already heard, Valve also produced a [Steam Deck booklet](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3401926123919972634).
