Two new Deck client updates have been pushed out to the Beta/Preview channel, both of which have come out on the same day. The first mostly focuses on fixes, including cloud sync being attempted while offline. Virtual menu previews in the Configurator now highlight the appropriate button when navigating to its associated command in the command list. On the Preview channel, a few more bugs have been fixed pertaining to the resolution dropdown screen, changing resolutions causing a crash, and the resolution dropdown sometimes showing an incorrect current resolution.

Not long afterwards, another update was pushed out. This is purely dedicated to Steam Input and FlickStick. In addition to the usual set of bug fixes, controller configurations are now automatically switched to be per-device when multiple of the same controller are connected at once. FlickStick update rate has been changed from 240hz to 120hz "to reduce instances of maxed out mouse movement between game frames." A "Slap Back" check was added so that the stick does not accidentally invoke an opposite-side turn when snapping home aggressively.
