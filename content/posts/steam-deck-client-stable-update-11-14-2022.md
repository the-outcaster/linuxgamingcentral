Those of you on the Stable branch on Deck should have received an update. A new startup movie has been added for BPM, and many issues have been fixed, including the standalone controller configurator showing at the incorrect browser scale. Patch notes are as follows:

**General**
- Fixed Steam desktop client browser scaling changing when New Big Picture Mode keyboard or controller configurator are opened

**New Big Picture Mode**
- Added new startup movie for Big Picture Mode (I tried to get a screenshot of this; the new movie isn't showing up for me)
- Fixed issue with Desktop version of Remote Play Together dialogs being displayed while in Big Picture Mode
- Re-worked "Gifts Pending" page to be gamepad navigable
- Fixed trackpad typing scale in standalone keyboard in Desktop mode
- Fixed issue where the Main Menu was visible after exiting, then re-entering Big Picture Mode
- Fixed standalone controller configurator showing at the incorrect browser scale
- Stopped showing Steam Deck interstitial screens when in Desktop mode

**Steam Input**
- Fixed issue with the touch binding in As Mouse mode releasing before the end of a swipe

Patch notes are also on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3383920059441129610).
