This came a bit earlier than I thought, but it's great nonetheless, as it comes with quite a few bug fixes.

First, in the Keyboard settings, you can now set the initial location for the OSK, as seen in the cover screenshot. It can be set on either the top or bottom, and this can be tweaked on a Desktop and Overlay basis.

Second, in your Steam library, you can now "fast jump" by letter by pressing left or right trigger.

Got a ton of games? Like, over 10,000? Startup times have now been "reduced" for you.

Besides that, everything else is bug fixes, from Steam Input, Desktop Mode, and everything in between.
