New Steam Deck client beta is now available for testing. Noteworthy additions in this update is the ability to log into your Steam account via a QR code, and the [updated Big Picture interface](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-ui-now-available-on-desktop/) (apparently there are some differences between this and the Steam Deck UI?). Load times have been reduced for accounts that have a large amount of games, and more than two Collections can be shown on screen. Some fixes have been added in regards to the incorrectly-sized Discovery Queue UI, the Main Menu when docked in 4K, touch-only menus, and library scrolling with a gamepad.

Steam Input got a nice change. In Desktop Mode, the Deck's controls will conform to a desktop-friendly format. Holding down the Menu button (presumably the Steam button) for a few seconds will convert the controls to a more gamepad-like input. Doubled input for Joy-Cons has now been fixed.

All of this and plenty more in the [patch notes](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3394051799812669718).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
