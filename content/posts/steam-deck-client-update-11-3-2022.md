Small update for today's Steam Deck client beta contains four fixes:
- Fixed issue where the re-order controllers dialog stopped working from the Quick Access menu
- Fixed issue in Desktop mode where the Steam Library was not loading properly
- Fixed issue where launching a game would take longer to start if there was no network connection.
- Fix issue starting any game with multiple Launch Options

Also, as a side note, yesterday's [update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-client-beta-update-11-2-2022/) included a toggle to use a Nintendo-style button layout. For some reason Valve didn't mention this at first, but later edited their [post](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3425577645359615160) to include this information.

Patch notes for today's update can also be seen on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3425577645362930709).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
