Less than a week after the last [stable update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-client-update-6-14-2023/), the Steam Deck gets another update to the stable branch. This update mostly focuses on bug fixes, although a few improvements snuck in as well.

Inviting a user to a game should no longer cause the overlay UI to soft-lock. When a PIN is entered, the main menu and QAM should now properly render.

Desktop Mode, as usual, gets a ton of fixes, ranging from small mode missing client update info, to screenshot sharing, to pop-up windows maximizing incorrectly, and everything in-between. The Achievements panel gets improved performance, and you can now clear in-game overlay data from a game's Properties menu. Friends & Chat, the in-game overlay, and Steam Input also gets a variety of fixes. Additionally, there is "improved support" for third-party Nintendo Switch controllers.

See the full patch notes on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3658659836548318817).
