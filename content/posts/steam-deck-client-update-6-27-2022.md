Just when you thought that there hadn't been any updates in a while for the Deck, today we get "a very nice set of bug fixes." Such as when scrolling through a EULA causing navigation issues, deleting a screenshot causing crashes, and the controller configurator not loading when Steam Cloud is disabled. Those things should no longer be a problem. Patch notes are as follows:
- Fixed an issue where clicking in-game links when offline would get Steam Deck into a bad state
- Fixed navigation issues in the game EULA dialog
- Fixed crashing issue when deleting a screenshot
- Fixed the controller configurator failing to load when Steam Cloud is disabled
- Fixed configurator failing to load when encountering corrupted controller layout files
- Fixed controller virtual menus being limited to 4 active menus
- Fixed a bug causing the touchscreen to occasionally be stuck in mouse-emulation mode when accessing the configurator in-game
