It's hard to predict the frequency of Steam Deck updates. Some weeks, they occur every day. Other weeks, there isn't one at all.

At any rate, one Steam Deck client update landed this week for beta and preview users that contains several fixes.

**General**
- Fixed issue where selecting a group chat showed an endless loading throbber until another chat was selected
- Fixed a regression in the beta client causing notification toasts to not show while playing a game.
- Fixed 'Delete Proton Files' not cleaning files that contain : in the path

**Desktop Mode**
- Fixed a case where the per-app Steam Play compatibility tool override dropdown would not appear

Patch notes can also be read on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3716073757577107452).

In other news, in case you weren't aware, the Deck is hitting brick and mortor stores in Japan. Says the post from [Komodo](https://komodo.jp/news/steamdeck-edion.html):
> KOMODO, an international game company and official distribution partner of Valveâ€™s Steam Deck in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, is extending the retail availability of three Steam Deck models and Docking Stations into Japan beginning April 29th at EDION Namba Main Store (Namba, Chuo-ku, Osaka). 

The same company will also be holding a "Steam Deck trail event" on the first floor of the EDION Namba Main Store to commemorate "the start of Steam Deck sales at physical stores in Japan." This will take place April 29th to May 7th.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
