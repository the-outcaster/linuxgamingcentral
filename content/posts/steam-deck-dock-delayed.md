In a move that probably surprised no one, Valve has delayed the production of the docking station for the Steam Deck. No word on when it will become available to purchase or what it will cost. "We're working on improving the situation and will share more info when we have it," the [post from Valve](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3328736287857025157) mentions.

Good news is the docking station is being manufactured at a different facility than the one the Steam Deck is. Meaning this doesn't affect the production schedule of the Deck.

Kind of saw this coming a mile away, as they had mentioned late Spring and we're already in late Spring. Delays certainly aren't anything new.
