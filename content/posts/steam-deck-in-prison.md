Whelp, I found something interesting while I was browsing my Reddit feed this morning. Someone posted a [photo of a Steam Deck...that's in a jail cell](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/v0rwri/playing_my_deck_in_prison/).

I'm 90% sure it's a Photoshopped meme, though. I highly doubt a device like that would be allowed. The Deck in the photo is also mysteriously hovering in the air; you can't see the hands on the sides of it. In case the background looks familiar, yes, the original poster confirmed this is in Alcatraz.

Well, if the Deck really was allowed in prison, it would definitely kill off boredom.
