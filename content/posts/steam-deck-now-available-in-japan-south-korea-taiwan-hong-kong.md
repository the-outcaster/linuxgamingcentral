Great news for those of you outside the US/UK. The Steam Deck is now available for reservation/purchase in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong! In a new [Steam blog post](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3413183219974962933), the following was mentioned:

> We are happy to announce today that Steam Deck is expanding to more regions. With the help of Komodo, Steam Deck will ship later this year in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

You can reserve via Valve's authorized reseller, [Komodo](https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/). Orders will start shipping "later this year." Additionally, Valve will be putting together an event at the Tokyo Game Show:

> To help introduce players to Steam Deck ahead of availability in these regions, we are working with Komodo to put together a large booth at the Tokyo Game Show, which will include a large hands-on section. Please stop by if you happen to be in town during TGS, we'd love to see you.

Great news! Looks like ekianjo, the owner of [Boiling Steam](https://boilingsteam.com), will finally be able to get his hands on a unit. Nice to see this being available to more people.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
