YouTuber [Hi-Tech Lo-Life](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/interview-with-hi-tech-lo-life/) recently put the [Steam Deck OLED to the test as far as battery life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQkpJ1qPUVA) with a handful of other devices. Out of itself, the Deck LCD, the Legion Go, and the ROG Ally, it's clear that the OLED was the winner across the board, with the exception of one test.

The first test he ran was putting an anime video on loop with VLC media player at 1080p resolution at 60 Hz. All devices were set to 1280 x 800 resolution, with the exception of the ROG Ally, which was set to 1280 x 720. Both Decks were set to 3 W, the Legion Go at 5 W, and the ROG Ally at 7 W (the lowest they could go). Results were as follows:
- Deck LCD: 4 hours 38 minutes
- ROG Ally: 4 hours 48 minutes
- Legion Go: 5 hours 28 minutes
- Deck OLED: 8 hours 41 minutes!

One caveat I might add here, is both the ROG Ally and Legion Go are running Windows, and their minimum TDP is higher than that of the Decks. Still, the OLED runs the video almost *twice* as long as the LCD model!

The next test was running a visual novel, with the same settings as the video:
- Deck LCD: 5 hours 2 minutes
- ROG Ally: 3 hours 26 minutes
- Legion Go: 5 hours 45 minutes
- Deck OLED: 12 hours 24 minutes

More realistically, though, we're primarily going to be playing games on these devices. So here were the results with *Celeste*:
- Deck LCD: 4 hours 40 minutes
- ROG Ally: 3 hours 25 minutes
- Legion Go: 3 hours 50 minutes
- Deck OLED: 10 hours 46 minutes

*Deathsmiles I* and *II*:
- Deck LCD: 3 hours 11 minutes
- ROG Ally: 3 hours 4 minutes
- Legion Go: 4 hours 5 minutes
- Deck OLED: 6 hours 31 minutes

How about AAA gaming? Here's the results for *Dark Souls III* with the "autodetect" graphics preset, 10 W TDP, 60 FPS/Hz:
- Deck LCD: 1 hour 37 minutes
- ROG Ally: 2 hours 2 minutes
- Legion Go: 3 hours 35 minutes
- Deck OLED: 3 hours 7 minutes

What? The Legion Go did better in this case? Here's what HTLL has to say:
>  I noticed an anomaly between the Legion Go -- despite being set to 10 watt TDP they didn't run so hot; they were running at around 20 FPS, which I wouldn't say is unplayable, but it's certainly no 30 FPS. Especially given the Steam Deck and the OLED were doing better at 10 watts, reaching a very respectable 40+ FPS, which could be the reason why the Legion Go defeated the Steam Deck OLED. But I'm not entirely sure; I feel like I'm missing a piece to this puzzle.

Now, the *Cyberpunk 2077* test, with all devices set to 15 W TDP, 60 Hz, using the "Steam Deck" preset:
- Deck LCD: 1 hour 12 minutes
- ROG Ally: 1 hour 19 minutes
- Legion Go: 1 hour 48 minutes
- Deck OLED: 2 hours 25 minutes

Dang. So, I guess if you want the longest-lasting battery out of all of the mainstream PC gaming handhelds out there, the Deck OLED is the way to go.

Thanks to HTLL for running these tests!
