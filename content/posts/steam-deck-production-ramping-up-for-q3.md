Good news for those of you still waiting on your Deck pre-order: now that the wave of Q2 emails have been sent out, Valve will reportedly be increasing the rate at which the device will be produced at the factory. @OnDeck reported on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1541459263444332544) that "production has picked up, and after today we'll be shipping **more than double** the number of Steam Decks every week!"

They'll even be sending Q3 emails a day early, on June 30th. Valve designer Lawrence Yang [chimed in](https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1541459415361921024), saying "We're looking forward to getting more Steam Decks into your hands! As you may imagine it's pretty difficult to make hardware right now, and the team has been kicking ass behind the scenes to keep Steam Deck production ramping."

So, thanks Valve for working so hard on getting these units sent out, I'm sure Q3 pre-orders will appreciate it!
