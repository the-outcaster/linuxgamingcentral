Great news! Starting today, you are no longer placed in a queue when ordering a Steam Deck. You can order one and have it shipped right away! Just keep in mind the following, per @OnDeck's [Tweet](https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1578090517426229250):
> We're doing our best to keep Steam Decks in stock, but there's always a chance demand will be outside our expectations. If that happens, some models in some regions might temporarily revert back to reservations, while we catch up.

Also, those of you in the Asian markets [will still be put in a queue via Komodi](https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1578090708866846720).

Holy freaking crap. Guess they were finally able to overcome the component shortage!

Not only this, but the official Steam Deck dock is now available. It features three USB type A 3.1 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI 2.0. It's currently priced at **$89**. Estimated delivery, at least according to my region in the US, is one-to-two weeks.
