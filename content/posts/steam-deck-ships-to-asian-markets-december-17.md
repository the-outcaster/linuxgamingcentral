After months of silence, it appears that @OnDeck has finally made an [announcement](https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1597776258414542849) for those of you waiting for your Deck in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

> We're happy to announce that Steam Decks will start shipping in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan on **December 17th** via Komodo, our official Steam Deck distributor in these regions.

Customers in these territories can reserve their Deck via [Komodo](https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/). If you have already reserved, email confirmations will be sent beginning tomorrow. The official docking station can also be reserved in addition to the Deck. There is "free shipping for orders placed prior to December 17th."

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
