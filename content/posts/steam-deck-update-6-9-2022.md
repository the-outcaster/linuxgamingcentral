Small update for Steam Deck users has landed today. Performance has been improved for the Recent Games carousel on the Home screen, and a few bug fixes have been added. Changelog is as follows:
- Improved performance for the Home screen Recent Games carousel
- Fixed boot glitching and crashes experienced by some customers
- Fixed Quick Access volume sliders not working after suspend/resume
- Fixed an issue in the controller reorder screen where moving to a controller slot higher than the current number of connected controllers would show as '!' until the Quick Access Menu screen is re-opened
