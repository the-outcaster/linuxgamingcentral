This week saw two hotfixes for the stable branch, an update to the beta branch, and an update for preview users.

**Stable:** controller layouts are [no longer forcefully updated](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3717201559842866010?l=english) when a game using game-bundled Steam Input API configurations updates their official configuration. A hotfix was released shortly thereafter "to fix a regression that caused some Steamworks enabled multiplayer game sessions to fail to connect."

**Beta:** [soundtrack playback controls](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3717201559849730423?l=english) have been added to both the library and the QAM. Steam Desktop Mode gets several fixes, a "Compatibility" tab gets added to change what version of Proton to use, and the in-game overlay/screenshot manager/player dialog gets some QoL improvements. The update was re-released with a few more bug fixes when signing in or downloading a game with a bandwidth limit set.

**Preview:** SteamOS [3.4.7](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3729585915988347091?l=english) updates the graphics driver to improve performance with *Star Wars: Jedi Survivor*, although apparently the game [still runs like trash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-qY-o9e8mM).

And in case you missed it: desktop users got a [sweet new beta update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3686801719529689367) with improvements to the overlay, a new toolbar, game overview, a new notes app, the ability to pin windows from the overlay, a more useful notification system, an improved screenshot manager, and hardware acceleration for Linux users. Mac users will get hardware acceleration in a future update.

This update seems to have finally fixed that pesky [Shift key issue](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3451#issuecomment-1528052513), where the Steam client thinks you still have the Shift key held down when switching tabs, causing multiple games to get selected.
