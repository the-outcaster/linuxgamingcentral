This week there were three beta client updates for the Steam Deck. Each update has been rather small in nature and mostly focuses on bug fixes.

# [Monday](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3677802763033132481) - Controller Configurator Performance Improvement
Steam Input gets "improved navigation" in the configurator from the Preview screen. There are two fixes for Xbox Enhanced Feature Support and PS4/5 gamepad effects when Steam Input is disabled.

# [Wednesday](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3678929205862814044) - Bug Fixes
Three fixes:
- one for achievement notifications not working when offline
- a second for Desktop Mode when navigation menus are hovered in Steam
- a third for Steam Input showing a blank page in the configurator

# [Friday](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3678929205868920362) - Improved Library Performance
Improved library performance for users with "large numbers of collections." Desktop Mode gets three fixes for Steam wallet, incorrect display of notifications, and the UI showing the wrong image when switching between small and normal mode.
