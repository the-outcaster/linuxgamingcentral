During the week of June 19th there were four beta client updates and one stable update. Three of the beta updates made it into the stable update on Wednesday.

# [Monday](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/6662560248457864762) - In-game Overlay Data Deletion
DualSense gamepads should now work properly when hotplugged. Three fixes for Desktop Mode, and in-game overlay data can now be cleared in the game's Properties menu.

# [Tuesday](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3658659836545150147) - Desktop Mode Fixes and Gyro Calibration Change
Overlay UI no longer soft-locks when inviting a friend to a game. Sharing screenshots should now function properly. Desktop Mode gets half-a-dozen bug fixes, and gyro calibration now uses a time window to calibrate rather than a fixed number of samples.

# [Wednesday](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3658659836548327352) - QAM Rendering Fix
Main menu and QAM should now render properly after entering a PIN at the lock screen. "Minimum Rumble Sustain" has been reverted from 3 seconds back to 10. Gyro/accelerometer support has been added to more third-party Switch gamepads.

Later that day, all of these changes were baked into the [stable update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-client-update-6-21-2023/).

# [Friday](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3658659836555625602) - Non-Steam Game Fixes
Screenshots for the proper non-Steam game should now be shown. The client window opening at login or when started with `-silent` flag for certain startup locations is now fixed. On Windows, non-Steam games should now be able to be properly added. Finally, a spoiler alert is now shown before viewing hidden achievements.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
