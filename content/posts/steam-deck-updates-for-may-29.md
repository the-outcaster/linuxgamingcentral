Last week were three beta client updates for the Steam Deck and a stable update to SteamOS.

# [Tuesday](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3705945096239306583) - Bell Icon
If there's not enough disk space available when downloading an update to a game, there should be an error now before running the game. A bell icon has been added to the header when there is a new notification. Rumble on DualShock gamepads is now fixed. Desktop Mode also gets a few fixes.

# [Wednesday](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3702568031445742630) - "Other" Tooltip and Stable SteamOS Update
An in-game overlay issue with the tabbed browser has been fixed. In Desktop Mode, a "Other" tooltip has been added that explains what it contains. There's also been two fixes for Desktop Mode.

The same day, [SteamOS 3.4.8](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steamos-3.4.8/) shipped to stable with a fix for *Splitgate* and improved performance with *Star Wars Jedi: Survivor*.

# [Thursday](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3702568031449199778) - Desktop Fixes Galore
Steam's servers should still be able to be connected to when resuming from sleep. Desktop Mode gets plenty of fixes, and a setting has been added to "let a user decide whether Ready to Play should include streaming and whether the local computer should be the default in details." Steam Input gets a fix for Joystick Dead Zones and gyro smoothing. Finally, a bug that caused "plain UDP connections to fail with authentication disabled" has been fixed.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
