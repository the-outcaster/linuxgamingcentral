It's not really news at this point (that's what happens when I'm a day late), but Steam now has a [Replay feature](https://store.steampowered.com/replay). This gives you an overview of what your top games were for that year, top genres, the platforms you played on percentage-wise, etc. Let's go over what I played this year.

I played 75 games, 42 of which were new. Top games, ordered from most-played to least, include:
1. *Borderlands 3*
2. [*Kena: Bridge of Spirits*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/kena-bridge-of-spirits-review/)
3. [*Sonic Frontiers*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/sonic-frontiers-review/)
4. *Splitgate*
5. *Horizon Zero Dawn*

I unlocked 308 achievements. Nearly *half* of the games I played were released this year.

Seems like I'm mostly into racing titles and Metroidvanias. Makes sense; [*Frontier Hunter: Erza's Wheel of Fortune*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/frontier-hunter-review/) is a great game. I also played [*Itorah*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/itorah_review/) earlier this year. Although I'm kind of surprised that "Fighting" isn't in the web. I assume "Chess" is in here because of the [*SokoChess*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/sokochess-review/) game I played a while back.

The top three months where I played games the most were February, September, and November, with November being number one at 17%. Again, makes sense considering all the guides I've written for *Sonic Frontiers*, and the game coming out that month.

78% of the time, I played games on Linux desktop. Only 22% of the remaining time was on Deck. 69 games were played on desktop; 47 on Deck. I'm happy to report I haven't touched a game at all this year on either Windows or Mac OS. People have said time and again that the Deck is the greatest thing on earth, and if you had read my [controversial review](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-review/) of the device, you would know that I disagree. I expect to get a lot of flak for having an opinion that's contrary to everyone else's, but on desktop I can enjoy higher framerates, easier modding, easier customization, higher resolutions, and a whole lot more. Bite me.

But continuing on with the discussion of the Deck, top games, ordered from most-played to least, are as follows:
1. *Sonic Frontiers*
2. *Horizon Zero Dawn*
3. *Portal*
4. *MultiVersus*
5. [*XEL*](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/xel-review/)

![Playtime on Deck](/images/steam/2022_replay/steam_deck.webp)

57% of the time I played with a gamepad. Actually kind of surprised it's not more than that; I *rarely* play a game with keyboard and mouse.

Longest daily gaming streak was from May 26th to June 8th -- a 13-day streak.

You can see the rest of my stats [here](https://store.steampowered.com/replay/76561198092605679/2022?l=english).

What are your stats? I'm curious what you've been playing in 2022.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
