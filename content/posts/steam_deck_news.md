My acquaintance (and who I work for on a freelance basis), [Gardiner Byrant](https://www.youtube.com/c/GardinerBryant), has released a new video today on his YouTube channel that covers a wide swath of Steam Deck news since the time the device went "live" on February 25th.

In it he covers Proton updates, specific games that were updated to have better Steam Deck support, how Valve has made development for the Steam Deck easier, Bungie's distaste for the Steam Deck, unofficial testing for titles on Deck through GamingOnLinux, the interview with Gabe from IGN, accessories for the Deck, Collabora's collaboration with Valve on SteamOS 3.0, Steam Deck availability, and even more. Even then, there's still news coming in day after day that we just can't keep up with.

Here's the TL;DR if you prefer the video in text format:
- Proton Experimental was updated; this includes updates to `wine-mono`, bug fixes for certain games, better steering wheel detection, and better compatibility with the *massively* popular *Elden Ring*
- `dxvk` is now standing at version [1.10](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10)
- `vkd3d-proton` has been updated to [2.6](https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.6)
- Several games have recently been updated to include better Steam Deck compatibility, ranging from Steam Input to UI changes. Games include *Albion Online*, *Factorio*, *The Long Dark*, *Terraria*, *Slay the Spire*, *Valheim*, *Oxygen Not Included*, *Tracks*, *SimplePlanes*, *One Deck Dungeon*, and probably a few others since the time of recording
- The game that we *never* thought would get Steam Deck support is *Apex Legends*. I have tested this personally and can confirm that the Easy Anti-Cheat solution is no longer a hindrance to playing the game through Proton. The game is now [Steam Deck Verified](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/apex-legends-gets-steam-deck-verified/) as well.
- We're at well over 1,000 Verified and Playable titles on the Steam Deck (over 1,220 according to [Boiling Steam](https://boilingsteam.com/1220-games-on-the-steam-deck-after-a-major-bump-including-apex-legends-as-verified/))
- Game developers can now add more info regarding Deck compatibility for their game via the Steam Events tool, and they also have access to a dashboard where they can see compatibility at a glance
- [Steam Deck update patch notes](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200) are now available to the public, for anyone to read
- [Bungie says no to Steam Deck support for *Destiny 2*](https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/360049024592-Destiny-2-Steam-Guide), and threatens to ban anyone trying to bypass the BattlEye anti-cheat associated with the game
- Liam Dawe from GamingOnLinux is open to [testing games on the Steam Deck](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/developers-let-us-know-if-you-need-help-with-steam-deck-testing/) to make sure they're running correctly on the device. Useful for game devs who don't have a dev kit. Testing is free!
- Gabe Newell is [confident of the Deck's future](https://boilingsteam.com/gaben-confident-about-the-steam-decks-future/). He's also been sighted as [hand-delivering Steam Decks to customers](https://youtu.be/9Dy-KWjp-m0) in the Seattle area
- dbrand is now offering accessories for the Deck, including [Project Killswitch](https://dbrand.com/killswitch) and a [tempered glass screen protector pack](https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/tempered-glass-screen-protectors?device=steam-deck#buy)
- Collabora played an important role in the development of SteamOS 3.0, including on making sure system updates are seamless. Details available on their [blog post](https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/portable-linux-gaming-with-the-steam-deck.html)
- [*Aperture Desk Job*](https://boilingsteam.com/aperture-desk-job-valves-back-at-it/) -- a game set in the *Portal* universe -- was released as a tech demo to showcase the Steam Deck's controls (desktop users aren't excluded though if they want to play it). Really fun game to play if you want to control a toilet armed with turrets. Available on Linux and Windows
- Good news for those of us still waiting in the queue to get our Deck; Valve expects to ramp up the production by the ["hundreds of thousands"](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/valve-expect-to-make-hundreds-of-thousands-of-steam-decks-next-month/) next month. Your queue may have been updated; have a look at your reservation to see where you stand

There's probably some other news that I haven't caught up on; I might just do a weekly post that goes over Steam Deck coverage, as there's *always* something new going on with that device every day. But hopefully you're now up-to-date, if you hadn't caught up on the news elsewhere.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
