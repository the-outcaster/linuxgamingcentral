A little late on this one, but I thought I'd mention it anyway since a lot of us are still waiting for the Deck to get into our hands.

Lawrence Yang from Valve had told IGN back in February that [the company would be producing Steam Decks by the hundreds of thousands beginning in April](https://youtu.be/okANKhicgkc). Looks like they lived up to their promise: instead of emails going out once a week to reservation holders, [they're now going out twice a week](https://twitter.com/ondeck/status/1511019543803543556?s=21&t=B4XC4evwICi-wBaSVeB4qA) during *certain* weeks, on Mondays and Thursdays. Great news for those who are in the Q2 category or later. Note that this won't be happening *every* week though. Yang also noted that ["order availability times are specific to each region."](https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1511351041803100164)

In other news, GOL noticed that GPD [is getting desparate against the Steam Deck](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/gpd-are-getting-quite-desperate-against-the-steam-deck/) by taking people's videos of the Deck and comparing them to the GPD Win without giving anyone credit. I have a GPD Win 3 myself and the DX12-to-Vulkan compatibility on the Mesa drivers with Intel Xe graphics is *horrible*. Let's see how much longer the company will survive.
