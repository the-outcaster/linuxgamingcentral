Small but important update out for both stable and preview branches on the Deck. SteamOS 3.4.4 (stable) [fixes](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3646258449543514488) an update loop that could occur when doing a factory reset. [3.4.5](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3646258449543530902) (preview) -- in addition to adding the update loop fix -- also fixes a focus issue with [*Forza Horizon 5*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551360/Forza_Horizon_5/).
