New update out for Preview users! SteamOS has been updated to 3.4.6. It has the following changes:
- Mesa upgraded to [23.1](https://wccftech.com/mesa-23-1-fixes-various-amd-radeon-rx-7000-rdna-3-gpu-issues-adds-long-awaited-cyberpunk-2077-rt-support/)
- "graphical corruption issues" fixed with [*Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1448440/Wo_Long_Fallen_Dynasty/) and "several upcoming titles"
- [*DOOM Eternal*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/) gets ray-tracing support

Since Mesa has been upgraded to 23.1, this should also [handle Steam's shader cache better](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-23.1-Cache-Evict-Optimize), and [less CPU overhead/VRAM use with Zink](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-Zink-DB-Descriptor-Mode). If the former is true then hopefully we will no longer have to spend [hours](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/steam-deck-long-pre-loading-and-patching/) waiting for games to update.

See the patch notes on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3650768394042637389). Note that **you will need to be on the Preview branch in order to get this update.** I'm also curious if any Deckers out there will notice less shader compilation time with this update; let me know if it's been improved!

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
