SteamOS 3.4.6 has shipped to stable users. As a reminder, SteamOS (or as Valve now calls it, "Steam Deck OS") 3.4.6 upgraded the **Mesa driver to version 23.1**. This upgrade should fix "graphical corruption issues" with *Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty*, although interestingly enough, the "several upcoming titles" tidbit from the beta patch notes has been omitted with this update. If you're a fan of *DOOM Eternal*, well, welcome to the next-gen upgrade with ray-tracing! Seems to be working [quite well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcHz4d6v_E0).

In addition, *Resident Evil 4* should no longer have any graphical corruption issues. Finally, Mesa 23.1 should provide [reduced shader cache time](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Mesa-23.1-Cache-Evict-Optimize) -- something that we all desperately needed.

One last thing -- *Forza Horizon 5* has a focus issue fixed.

See the patch notes on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3675538825744699879).
