SteamOS -- or, as Valve has been labeling it lately, Steam Deck OS -- has now been updated on the stable branch. Not too much going on with this update. A GPU crash in *Splitgate* was fixed with an update to the graphics driver stack, and there are performance improvements with *Star Wars Jedi: Survivor*.

Patch notes can also be read on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3702568031445749186).
