Some Deck users were apparently experiencing stuttering issues with the [SteamOS 3.3 update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/stable-steamos-3.3-update-and-deck-client-update/). Though I never had such a problem myself, at least it's good to know Valve is addressing the feedback. I haven't tested *Red Dead Redemption 2* on Deck but it seems that game had a VRAM issue too. Here is what's new with today's SteamOS beta update:
- Temporarily reverted RDR2 VRAM workaround to pre-3.3 behavior
- Fixed an issue causing random 0.2s stutter
- Fixed an issue causing performance drops when a UI element appeared on screen if the performance HUD was enabled

Note that since this is a SteamOS update, you will need to be in the **Preview** branch in order to get the update.

You can also see the patch notes on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3360267192939212657).
