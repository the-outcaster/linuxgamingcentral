[SteamTinkerLaunch](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/) -- an awesome wrapper for games played through Proton -- is now available on [Flathub](https://github.com/flathub/com.valvesoftware.Steam.Utility.steamtinkerlaunch). Seems like the link isn't available on Flathub directly, but you should be able to install the app with:

`flatpak install com.valvesoftware.Steam.Utility.steamtinkerlaunch`

Great news for you Steam Deck owners! Or for those of you who primarily use Flatpaks as your applications. Check out the overview of SteamTinkerLaunch on [Boiling Steam](https://boilingsteam.com/supercharge-steam-with-steamtinkerlaunch-stl/).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
