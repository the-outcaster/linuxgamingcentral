[SteamTinkerLaunch](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch) -- the Swiss army knife for configuring games run through Proton -- just got a big update yesterday. Included in this release are French, Polish, and Chinese translations, the ability to automatically bump the used official Proton version per game, GameScope support with NVIDIA Image Scaling 1.0.2, Flatpak support, a DXVK framerate limiter option, new FSR options, MangoApp support, improved Origin integration, and *tons* of other features/bug fixes!

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/releases/tag/v11.0).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
