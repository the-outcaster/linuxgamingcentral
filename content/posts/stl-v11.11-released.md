SteamTinkerLaunch version 11.11, codenamed "!Elfeins" came out yesterday. Here's some of the highlights:
- Polish translation updated
- non-Steam Proton games should now launch
- `obs-vkcapture` was changed to `obs-gamecapture` so OpenGL and Vulkan games can be recorded
- non-Steam games are now listed as a category
- Deck improvements; cabextract is now handled automatically, and a differentiation has been added when running the launcher in Game Mode versus Desktop Mode
- custom Proton list is now automatically updated if newly added Proton versions are possibly missing
- several bug fixes and improvements

To coincide with this release, ProtonUp-Qt has also been [updated](https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/releases/tag/v2.7.4) to fix the STL installer.

YouTuber Hi-Tech Lo-Life recently did a [video](https://youtu.be/4FRU2fuvLlw) on STL, and describes it as "a Swiss army knife utility for your Deck." Check it out if you want to learn more about the project!

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/releases/tag/v11.11).
