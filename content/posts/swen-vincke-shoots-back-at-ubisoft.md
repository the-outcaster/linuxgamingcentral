You probably heard Ubisoft's director of subscriptions, Philippe Tremblay, mentioning to [gamesindustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-ubisoft-and-getting-gamers-comfortable-with-not-owning-their-games) that gamers should feel "comfortable with not owning your game" due to subscription services like Xbox Game Pass becoming more popular. And you probably thought, "The nerve of that guy!"

And, despite X/Twitter being a somewhat hostile place, I do get a good chuckle out of it every once in a while. Take a look at some of the [responses](https://twitter.com/ign/status/1747469062618099879) he got:

If it makes you feel any better, Swen Vincke, CEO of Larian Studios -- the company behind *Baldur's Gate 3* -- also went in at the [potential dangers of game subscription services](https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/1747556874562457799):
> Whatever the future of games looks like, content will always be king. But it’s going to be a lot harder to get good content if subscription becomes the dominant model and a select group gets to decide what goes to market and what not. Direct from developer to players is the way.

He further goes on to say "subscription models will always end up being cost/benefit analysis exercises intended to maximize profit" and "we are already all dependent on a select group of digital distribution platforms and discoverability is brutal. Should those platforms all switch to subscription, it’ll become savage."

He makes it clear that "you won't find our games on a subscription service...I just want to make sure the other ecosystem doesn't die because it's valuable."

Glad to see I'm not the only one who actually still sees the value in "owning" your games as opposed to "renting" them.
