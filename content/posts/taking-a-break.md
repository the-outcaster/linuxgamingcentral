As I did [last year](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/i-need-a-break/), I'll be taking anywhere from a few days to a few weeks off. Now that I've gotten most of the articles that I've needed to take care of out of the way, I can finally get some rest.

Some things to look forward to when I get back:
- [*Headbangers*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761620/Headbangers_Rhythm_Royale/) and [*Battle Shapers*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1421290/Battle_Shapers/) game reviews
- [Rainbow 2 Pro controller](https://www.bigbigwon.com/product/controller/rainbow-2-pro/) review
- eXtremeRate [clicky kit for Steam Deck](https://extremerate.com/products/extremerate-face-clicky-kit-for-steam-deck-console) review
- my recommended themes for CSS Loader on Steam Deck
- winesapOS review
- how to set up HDR (*Smash Ultimate*) on Steam Deck -- this will likely be a video tutorial

Things that I'm looking into but may not happen:
- interview with Fizzi, creator of Slippi
- interview with James Ramey from CodeWeavers
- interview with the DeckHD team
- Bazzite review
- other things that -- as usual -- I'm likely forgetting to mention

I also wanted to take this opportunity to ask: how am I doing? I've noticed as of the past few weeks there hasn't been much feedback on any of my articles.

Wishing everyone a safe winter this year!
