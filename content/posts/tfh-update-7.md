Seems like it's been a *long* time since we got an update from the 2D fighting game *Them's Fightin' Herds*. Well, not to worry, we've finally been updated on what's going on with the game.

Last year, the game got [ported to Linux](https://boilingsteam.com/thems-fightin-herds-linux-version-now-live/). Some time later the Mac version went up as well. Now **the game will be heading to consoles later this Fall.** While it may not seem like a big deal for us Linux gamers, the good news is all versions will have cross-platform multiplayer, meaning on PC you can play against someone on Switch, for example. This means you'll have an even greater chance of finding someone to play with.

Looks like **version 3.0 of the game is coming soon.** I would expect sometime later this year. Version 3.0 will include level 3 supers for the characters, as well as "fresh balance changes" across many of the game's universal mechanics. The forum post mentions we can look forward to more info on this at the [PC Gaming Show](https://www.pcgamingshow.com/) on June 12th.

Chapter 2 of the Story mode with Velvet is still in the works, but unfortunately it looks like this won't be given priority until after the console ports have arrived.

There's a couple of other things going on, including additional language support, Combo Breaker, and details on physical crowdfunded rewards. Check Mane6's [forum post](https://forums.themsfightinherds.com/index.php?threads/development-update-7-tfh-is-coming-to-consoles.2405/) for more info.
