Just wanted to provide a quick update on that [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/moving-on/) that I wrote over the weekend about moving on.

You would think the Internet would be the last place to get support and encouragement, but I can't believe the amount of comments that came in, the DMs I got on Discord, and the replies I got on Mastodon. They were all very supportive. Even Joey Sneddon from [OMG! Ubuntu](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/) and [OMG! Linux](https://www.omglinux.com/) came in to offer words of comfort. I didn't get *one* negative or critical remark. It was surprising. In a way I kind of feel bad now for expressing how I felt; I felt like I was just dumping my stress out on anyone who read that post. I didn't mean to add to anyone's burden. All of us have got plenty enough to deal with already. I guess I'm just new to this thing called "burnout" that every content creator/journalist and their brother has to deal with.

**LGC isn't going away.** But I need to slow down and resist the urge to immediately report on something the second the news goes around. As some of you had said, it's *how* I deliver the news that you appreciate; not how quickly I get to it.

I compiled a list of your comments into a document, printed it out, and stuck it on my fridge. It's funny, I bought this Xbox fridge several months ago and I barely used it, but now I have a purpose for it: it will serve as my reminder whenever I need a "pick-me-up". Ignore my poor cutting skills and the use of scotch tape to keep the comments on; I know it makes the fridge look rather ugly, but in a sense it sparks beauty in other ways. Not only because of the lovely artwork my friend's wife made, but also your wonderful comments. It's something I can quickly look to when I'm sitting here at my desk, and they will *always* be here if in case Mastodon, Discord, or any of those places go away.

I filled every side of the fridge with the comments, including the back. The left side is full of the DMs that I got, so I won't be showing that part, but I can assure you they are just as comforting as the rest of the comments are. Some of these comments were written months ago, but they still hold just as much value today as they did back then.

While it will likely always be a battle trying to fight off feelings of envy for the things other content creators get, or the amount of popularity they have, there's one thing that I have that most of them don't: **a support line.** My "fanbase" may be small. It may be niche. But I think what could potentially make other creators/journalists envious of *me* is how loyal my followers are. I don't think they get the same amount of support and encouragement that I do. Sure, I've had to occassionally deal with toxic commenters -- no journalist is immune to that. But it's far, *far* less than what the bigger guys have to put up with.

So, Linus Tech Tips might get early hands-on with the ASUS ROG Ally. ETA Prime might get sent every handheld in existence. They might get paid the big bucks in addition to having a "free" review unit. But I get the loving support of my followers and readers. I may have never seen your face before, and a lot of you comment anonymously, so I don't even know your name either. But the fact that you take the time to write your thoughts down...it means a lot to me. Someone even stuck up for me when I was moderating the toxic comments I was getting on the [negative Steam review post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/negative-steam-reviews-may-no-longer-exist/).

**Thank you for your support, and the wonderful, upbuilding comments that you have sent.** It has helped me out more than you know, and now that I have your comments readily available to read at any moment's notice, it should serve as my "therapy" whenever I need it. I also got a few donations since writing that post, so thanks for that as well.

I'm also happy to announce that **from time-to-time I'll be writing for another Steam Deck website** that has more outreach than I do, in addition to writing here on LGC. Don't want to get into too much detail about it at the moment, as I'm still working out details with the website owner, but hopefully it will spread the good word around and give me some opportunities that I've never had before.

Again, thank you for your love, your support, and your encouragement. If I ever do go on a rant like that in the future...well, let's just say I'll try to keep the rants to a minimum. There's a lot of negativity out there in the world and I don't want to be another source of that. I want to keep this website positive, clean, and useful.

**TL;DR**

- thank you for the support
- LGC will still be around, but articles may be showing up less frequently
- partnering with a Steam Deck-related website

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
