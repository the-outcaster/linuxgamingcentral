Back in September, System76 unveiled their [newly-designed Thelio desktops](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/system76-unveils-new-thelio/), with swappable front accents. There were a few designs to choose from, but now it's possible to create your own. The idea was inspired by GloriousEggroll's [customized Thelio design](https://twitter.com/GloriousEggroll/status/1587223441458884609).

> Today, System76 introduces the Thelio Maker Accent, a DIY accent for users to add their own personal spin to their PC. A blank aluminum slate, users are free to paint, etch, gloss, or adhere objects to.

Priced at $15, the Maker Accent kit comes with one aluminum panel, one aluminum test panel, and one aluminum carrier. A guide for customizing your accent can be found on [System76's website](https://system76.com/weekend-project/maker-accent). I'd love to make a Sonic-inspired one!

Get your Thelio [here](https://system76.com/desktops#product-cards). I should have the Thelio review out on Friday.
