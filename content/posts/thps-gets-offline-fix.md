*Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2*, which arrived on Steam earlier this month after being a long-time EGS exclusive, and which also got a fix with last week's [Proton Experimental update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-experimental-update-10-11-2023/), got a [patch](https://support.activision.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-update) a few days ago. Users can now play the game without having to connect to the Internet. Oddly enough, however, desktop users will not benefit from this update.

Don't quote me on this, but I *believe* you can bypass the Steam Deck restriction on desktop by passing in the `-steamdeck` parameter in the game's launch options. That may not be the exact wording of the command, but there should be a command that makes the game think you own a Steam Deck (DuckDuckGo isn't giving me much for results, but I *do* know there's a command out there).

Along with the update, the OSK should now work properly on Deck.

See the patch notes [here](https://support.activision.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-update), and the game on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395210/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_1__2/).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
