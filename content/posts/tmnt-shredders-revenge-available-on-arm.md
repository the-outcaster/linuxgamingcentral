Not only has the game enjoyed massive popularity -- as it [sold over one million copies in just its' first week](https://www.gematsu.com/2022/07/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-sold-over-one-million-units-in-first-week) -- but now [it's been ported over to ARM](https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/07/11/tmnt-shredders-revenge-on-retro-handhelds/). Any retro gaming device you can think of, such as the ODROID Go Advance or the various ARM-powered devices by Anbernic, can now play this game. Looks like you'll need to have a copy of the game on Steam first before you can copy it over to your SD card and play on a retro console/handheld. Instructions are provided in the linked article.

I have the game myself and confirm it's a *great* game to own and play. It's one of those cases where I'm glad they didn't rush it. It's definitely got that retro SNES vibe to it, including the sound effects. It's also native to Linux and works *fantastically* on Deck. I have an ODROID Go Advance somewhere, but I don't know what happened to it. I'll be certain to give this game a try on that once I find it.
