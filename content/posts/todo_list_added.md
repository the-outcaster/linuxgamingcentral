As the title of the post mentions, I have now added a to-do list for LGC on the [GitHub's README file](https://github.com/linuxgamingcentral/website), including new features to add to the site, bug fixes, and future planned articles. This is so you can get an idea of content to look forward to, and it also serves as a reminder for me what I need to work on. Note that some articles have lower priority than others and may not be worked on. Here's a shameless copypasta from the README:

## Website Tasks
Tasks will have a checkmark next to them when they're done.
- Additions
  - add a Matrix room
  - add Twitter
  - add a newsletter subscription feed
  - add stats for page view counts
  - add a logo
  - automatically upload changes from LGC to GitHub
- Bug fixes
  - fix apparent [CSS theming bug](https://github.com/linuxgamingcentral/website/issues/4) for some people who are trying to log in to Matrix
  - fix [stretched avatar bug](https://github.com/linuxgamingcentral/website/issues/3) for extended comments

## Planned Articles (Besides News)
- How to set up and use Proton GE
- Setting up Slippi
- Switch emulation with Ryujinx
- Ryujinx vs. Yuzu: which is better?
- [Project Heartbeat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1216230/Project_Heartbeat/) review
  - Interview with dev
- System76 interview
- ChimeraOS interview

- May happen, may not
  - Weekly featured Linux game
  - Guide(s) on how to use Linux and set it up for gaming
  - Why I left Boiling Steam
  - Borderlands 3 review
  - Steam Deck review, once I get it
  
Don't forget that LGC is open-source too, so if you're a web developer and you know of a solution to the wacky login theme and stretched avatar bugs, for example, you could probably implement it faster than I can. For that reason, I have updated the instructions for building the site to make it a little clearer. And, of course, I'm all ears for anything else that you-all want me to cover.

That's all for now. More posts to come...once I get some rest.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
