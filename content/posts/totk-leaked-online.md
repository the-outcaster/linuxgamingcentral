I don't think it really comes as a surprise that one of Nintendo's hottest lineups of 2023 have started to appear online before it officially hits retail shelves. But what comes more of a surprise is *how early* the game got leaked.

Physical copies of *Tears of the Kingdom* might have fallen off a truck while en route to its destination; people have managed to obtain these copies and sell them up to $300 on eBay just yesterday. It would naturally follow that a few hours later, these copies would be dumped and then distributed online. So, people have been able to play the game nearly two weeks ahead of schedule. Some have even had the audacity to publicly stream the game on Twitch, only to naturally get hit with a copyright strike half-an-hour later.

I'm relieved to tell you **there is no DRM**. Well, at least for the time being. There might be DRM when the game officially launches on the 12th, but seeing as it can [run poorly on native hardware](https://kotaku.com/zelda-totk-switch-performance-framerate-tears-kingdom-1850378556), I really can't imagine even more overhead being tossed in with Denuvo running on top. This means people have been able to get *Tears of the Kingdom* running on both PC and Steam Deck with Ryujinx. According to the Yuzu developers, they won't be adding support for the game until it officially launches.

Viewsink [managed to see a Reddit post of *TOTK* running on Steam Deck](https://viewsink.com/ge-proton8-1-release-totk-on-deck-re4r-top-5/) before the user deleted their post. Reddit user Unknowntypebeat mentioned the game runs around 15 to 20 FPS, with the UMA frame buffer size set to 4 GB. Doesn't seem too bad, actually!

In the meantime, as a lot of other folks have cautioned, if you don't want spoilers, you may want to avoid YouTube or other websites that are already leaking footage of the final boss and whatnot. As aggressive as the big N is with their copyright strikes, I don't think they're going to be able to keep up with all the leaks that are being uploaded.
