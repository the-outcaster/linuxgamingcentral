Whelp, I never thought this would see the light of day. But it did.

As [It's FOSS](https://news.itsfoss.com/tuxedo-os/) brought out earlier today, Tuxedo Computers has finally made their tailor-made distro, Tuxedo OS, available *outside* of their own hardware. You can download their ISO and install it on any computer now. No need to use their [WebFAI flash drive](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-WebFAI.tuxedo). Meaning that you can hopefully install it with a graphical interface, while being able to configure your partitions, and not have to use an Ethernet connection.

Tuxedo OS is based off of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. It uses KDE Plasma as the desktop environment and includes [Tuxedo Control Center](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-Control-Center.tuxedo) and [Tuxedo Tomte](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/What-is-TUXEDO-Tomte.tuxedo) (driver configuration service), along with a few other smaller tweaks, such as accent color and wallpaper set. Snap is disabled by default, and it has the NVIDIA drivers included.

Note that, even though the drivers and software packages available in the distro are open-source, the distro itself isn't. Hopefully it won't be long before the source code becomes available.

If you're feeling brave enough, you can [download](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-OS_1.tuxedo) the distro and try it out yourself. And if you're looking for a review on their hardware, check out my impressions of their [Pulse Gen 2 laptop](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/tuxedo-pulse-gen2-review/).
