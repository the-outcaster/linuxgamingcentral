Yup, the Twitter account for LGC is now [live](https://twitter.com/linuxgamingctr). Give me a follow if you want to get your news feed from there, outside of the website itself and outside of the RSS feed. There I will also be posting teasers of my future articles. For instance, I've teased my *Project Heartbeat* review by showcasing the game on my GPD Win 3:

DMs should also be open if you want to get a hold of me there rather than email. Once I get a proper logo for the site then I can replace the profile picture of myself with it. I'd also like to replace the generic background on my profile at some point. Finally, I've added a link in the navigation bar so you can get easy access to the Twitter URL.

Still debating on whether to use Discord or Matrix for a chat room. Or maybe some other FOSS solution. Don't like Discord being proprietary, but Matrix probably won't have as many users. Haven't figured it out yet. But there will be a chat room eventually.

Note that **Twitter may not be permanent**. I've used Twitter before and I don't like unpopular opinions or political news getting shoved down my throat. Going to be careful who I follow.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
