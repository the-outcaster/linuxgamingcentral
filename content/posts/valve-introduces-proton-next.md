![Selecting Proton Next](/images/proton/proton_next/cover.png)

More or less the same update back when it was [a release candidate](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/proton-7.0-5-rc/). The only differences I'm seeing, as far as additions, are:

- *Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition* is playable with this release
- *Batman: Arkham City* Steam Deck fix has been added to this release
- several game-specific fixes have been added to this release

Things that have been removed include:
- *Warhammer: Vermintide 2* and *ToGather:Island* is not on the playable list
- OpenXR compatibility with *Blacktop Hoops* is no longer available
- network video support for *The Good Life* is no longer present

To use Proton Next, it's now available in the dropdown menu when selecting what Proton version to use for a game, rather than having to select the `release-candidate` beta.

See the patch notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog#available-in-proton-next).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
