*Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl* got a much-needed quality-of-life update. Previously, characters had no voices, although you could technically [mod them in](https://boilingsteam.com/installing-mods-for-nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-nasb-on-linux/). It made matches feel empty.

Well that's no longer the case as of today's [update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1414850/view/3333239887491663354). All characters now have voices as they jump, do a smash attack, or taunt. I'm happy to see my favorite character, Jenny Wakeman, still voiced by the same actress as the show that she was in: Janice Kawaye.

What may be a bit more controversial, however, is the introduction of items. Items are now in the game. Nobody likes items in *Smash Bros.* Hopefully they're not allowed in competitive mode. But maybe the more casual players will appreciate them.

There's some other small adjustments in the update as well. The default stock count is now four instead of three. Some minor changes have been made to stages as well as individual characters. Have a look at the [patch notes](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1414850/view/3333239887491663354) on Steam for more info.
