The web server is now live. HTTPS is enabled by default (man, what a PITA it was to get that set up), and you should be able to add comments to posts via Cactus Comments (no account, no approval required).

As noted in the [About](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/about/) section of the site, Linux Gaming Central is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The Terminal theme is brought to you by [panr](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal). Web site source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/linuxgamingcentral/website) and licensed under GPLv3.

I will try to make it a goal to have at least one post per day, even if it's a low-effort, two-paragraph news short. *Most* of LGC's content will be Linux gaming-related news, such as Proton updates, a new game that was ported to Linux, etc. but the blog will also be sprinked with game reviews, hardware reviews, occassional opinions, interviews with various Linux developers, and probably more than that. I may infrequently cover topics related to the Nintendo Switch and other consoles. If you want the blog to stay purely focused on Linux gaming content, however, feel free to voice your opinion in the comments.

Within this week or next I'm hoping to have the following content released, besides daily news coverage:
- Guide to using Slippi on Linux (*Super Smash Bros. Melee* with rollback netcode)
- Guide to emulating Switch games on Linux with Ryujinx
- A couple of dev interviews set up with folks like alkazar79 (creator of ChimeraOS), GloriousEggroll, Thomas Castleman of Drauger OS, etc.
- Game review of *Persona 4 Arena Ultimax*, provided I can get a review copy (I'll still probably have a review if I have to buy it, but the downside to that is I can't have the review out on release day, causing the view count to significantly decrease)
- Probably some other stuff that I can't think of right now

As time goes on I may incorporate a Discord channel and a newsletter subscription feed, but at the moment I'm trying to keep things simple and make my workload as light as possible.

In the meantime, if you got feedback, let me know! I'm eager to hear your thoughts. You can also talk to me in private by [sending an email](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/contact/).

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
