I hadn't watched this year's Gamescon, but thanks to Steam Deck HQ, they did a quick [summary](https://steamdeckhq.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2022-roundup-of-every-announcement/) of the games presented. One particular game that caught my eye was [*High on Life*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583230/High_On_Life/). It's a humorous FPS with aliens. The gun the main character uses has a personality and talks to him. Per the Steam store page description:

> Humanity is being threatened by an alien cartel who wants to use them as drugs. Itâ€™s up to you to rescue and partner with charismatic, talking guns, take down Garmantuous and his gang, and save the world!

The game was created by Justin Roiland, co-creator of *Rick & Morty* and *Solar Opposites*. From the gameplay, you can definitely tell it's got that *Rick & Morty* vibe to it.

So here's what we know so far about the game:
- [DLC is already planned](https://www.thegamer.com/high-on-life-dlc-post-launch-updates/)
- game is expected to be [12-20 hours](https://www.thegamer.com/high-on-life-how-many-hours-to-beat/)
- will be out on Steam and Xbox on December 13th (it was originally planned for October but got pushed back)
- there will be some pretty sick humor that isn't for everyone (the talking knife talks about cutting open someone's arsehole and eating it)
- here's some [footage](https://www.gameinformer.com/gamescom-2022/2022/08/23/high-on-life-watch-a-profanity-laden-boss-fight-against-9-torg-in-new) of versing one of the bosses, 9-Torg
- IGN recorded the [first 25 minutes of gameplay](https://youtu.be/jN3thUvIQHY)
- some other stuff I'm probably forgetting

Will be interesting to see how well the game plays on Deck. I'm looking forward to trying this game out myself!
