I've added a link in the navigation bar to access LGC's "timeless" articles. Guides, game reviews, interviews with developers, and whatever else I may cover. As LGC constantly provides new articles every day, these older articles can be difficult to find. So, I made [this page](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/articles_to_bookmark) to make finding these articles easier.

So far I've got the Slippi guide, tips for playing *GRID Legends* on NVIDIA graphics cards, how to use the Steam Deck UI, the *Project Heartbeat* review, and a few developer interviews. Of course, this page will continue to get updated as more articles come.

I've also updated the `config.toml` file to include 10 articles per page rather than 5, so you don't have to constantly click "Older posts" or "Newer posts" when browsing the website.

Of course, I'm all ears for other suggestions to improve LGC in any way, as long as I know how to do it. (I still haven't found a solution to the stretched avatar bug for comments.)

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
