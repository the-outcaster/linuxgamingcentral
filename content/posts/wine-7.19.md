The dev release of Wine 7.19 is out. Notable improvements to this version include:
- VKD3D has been updated to v1.5, which adds support for more HLSL shading language features
- MPEG-4 audio support
- 17 bug fixes, including fixes for *Resident Evil Revelations 2*, *Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3*, and *Sonic Adventure DX (2004)*

See the patch notes on [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.19). It probably won't be long before GE-Proton picks up this update. We should be expecting Wine 8.0 [early next year](https://www.phoronix.com/news/WineConf-2022-Highlights).
