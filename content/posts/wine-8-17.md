Wine 8.17 (dev release) released yesterday and with it comes initial window management support in the Wayland driver, SoundFont support in DirectMusic, and 19 bug fixes. VKD3D 1.9 has also been bundled in this release -- which, according to the patch notes on the [WineHQ GitLab](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/vkd3d/-/releases/vkd3d-1.9), contains "improvements to the HLSL compiler" and "miscellaneous bug fixes."

Gaming-related fixes have been added for *Elder Scrolls: Oblivion*, Cemu 1.12.0, RageMP, *Dwarf Fortress*, SRPG Studio games, and *ReCore*.
