The stable Wine 8.0 release got a new update. Note that this is not to be confused with the development branch, which just released [8.6](https://www.winehq.org/announce/8.6). Mac OS Ventura 13.3 gets fixes, Tamil and Turkish translations have been updated, and a total of 36 bugs have been fixed, including fixes for "What's the Secret?" and *Saints Row: The Third*.
