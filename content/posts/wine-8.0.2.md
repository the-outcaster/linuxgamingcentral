New update to Wine is now out on the **stable** branch as opposed to the typical updates shipped to the dev branch. A total of 27 bugs have been squashed since the [8.0.1](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/wine-8.0.1/) update back in April. *Hogwarts Legacy* and *Sins of the Solar Empire Rebellion* should no longer crash on unimplemented function. There should no longer be a Qt error when installing or updating Battle.NET. It shouldn't take nine minutes to extract the *Pro Evolution Soccer 2008* demo.

Along with this is plenty of other fixes for things like the *Genshin Impact* launcher, *Devil May Cry 1*, Chromium, Chocolatey OpenSSH, and LibreVR Revive.

See the patch notes on [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org//announce/8.0.2).
