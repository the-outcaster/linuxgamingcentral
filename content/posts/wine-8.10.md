Wine 8.10 (dev release) has just been released and incorporates mouse cursor clipping improvements (by "improvements" I'm assuming they mean it happens less often), support for virtual memory placeholders, updates for local and timezone data, and all PE -> Unix transitions are now handled via the syscall interface.

Additionally 13 bugs have been fixed in this release. Game-specific fixes are included for TwitchTest and *Animated Puzzles*.

See the patch notes on [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org//announce/8.10).
