26 bugs have been fixed with the release of Wine 8.11. Additionally, there are further mouse cursor clipping "improvements," support for TLS (Transport Layer Security) alerts, and "increased available address space in WoW64 mode."

Game-related fixes are included for *StarCraft II* and Lunar Magic. Steam and Ubisoft Connect also get a fix for not showing anything after launch in virtual desktop mode.

See the patch notes on [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org//announce/8.11).
