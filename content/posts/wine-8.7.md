Wine 8.7 brings "more spool file improvements," DXBC shader parsing "delegated to VKD3D," and fixes 17 bugs. Bug fixes are included for *Street Fighter 4*'s benchmark tool, *ReVolt 1207*, *Shapes on a Plane*, *Unravel*, *Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice GOTY*, *Dark Souls III*, and *Final Fantasy XI Online*.

Also, interestingly enough, it appears that the *Genshin Impact* launcher got a memory leak fixed during HTTPs download.

See the patch notes on [WineHQ](https://www.winehq.org/announce/8.7).
