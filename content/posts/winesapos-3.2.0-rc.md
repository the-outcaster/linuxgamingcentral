WinesapOS -- the portable Linux distro that lets you use Linux on any flash drive without having to install it -- has evolved from alpha to [beta](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/winesapos-3.2.0-beta/) to what is now the release candidate. Here's some noteworthy changes:
- VirtualBox support in addition to VMware Fusion/Workstation. The latter is recommended for 3D acceleration
- improved Mac support, with better fan control and Wi-Fi support
- PolyMC has now been replaced with [Prism Launcher](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/prism-launcher/) for your *Minecraft* needs
- improved Xbox and Xbox 360 controller support
- the NVIDIA Flatpak runtime is now updated whenever the distro is upgraded -- this prevents upgrade issues

As with the beta release there are some known issues with workarounds:
- Steam Deck client shows corrupt graphics – use “Steam Desktop” instead
- Steam Deck client can’t login – check the guide on [PS4Linux](https://ps4linux.com/steam-deck-ui-ps4-linux/) for troubleshooting tips

See the patch notes for the release candidate on [GitHub](https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS/releases/tag/3.2.0-rc.0). To see *all* the changes since WinesapOS entered 3.2.0, see the patch notes [here](https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS/blob/3.2.0-rc.0/CHANGELOG.md).
