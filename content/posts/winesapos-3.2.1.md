Not much has changed since the [3.2.0 update](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/winesapos-3.2.0/), but still worth talking about. Here are the highlights:
- the distro has switched to the renamed SteamOS 3.4 repo names -- older versions "caused a lot of issues for users"
- swappiness level decreased from 10% to 1%
- password can be changed during first-time setup

See the full patch notes and download on [GitHub](https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS/releases/tag/3.2.1). And stay tuned for an interview with Luke Short, the WinesapOS maintainer!
