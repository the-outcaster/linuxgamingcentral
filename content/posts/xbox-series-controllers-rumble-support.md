Earlier today Phoronix had [noticed](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Latest-Xbox-Rumble-Driver) a new patch being submitted for the Microsoft HID Linux driver. The patch was created by Google engineer Siarhei Vishniakou, who is "in communication" with engineers from Microsoft.

Last year, a firmware update had apparently broke the rumble compatibility with Xbox One controllers. This patch fixes the problem, and also works with the newer Series X|S controllers. It might even work with the Elite pad.

See the [patch](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20221020161401.941927-1-svv@google.com/) for more details. Hopefully this will get merged into the kernel soon. Although, [I honestly wouldn't recommend using a Series X|S pad on Linux](https://boilingsteam.com/the-series-x-controller-on-linux-a-bit-of-a-hassle/), due to terrible wireless connectivity.

**WARNING: LGC will be shutting down March 7, 2024. See this [post](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/the-end-of-lgc/) for more details.**
