Supporting Linux Gaming Central via monetary contributions will *always* be entirely optional. Nevertheless, much time and work goes into keeping up-to-date with everything going on in the Linux and Steam Deck world. Not only in keeping up-to-date with news, but the research that goes into the various guides that I write, and the time I have to put in for game reviews and hardware reviews.

Donations will go towards:
- coffee
- server maintenance, domain name, and Plausible Analytics costs
- games and hardware for review

There are several ways that you can donate, depending on your preferences:
- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/user?u=71100710) -- Patreon members get access to an exclusive Discord channel
- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/linuxgamingcentral/)
- [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/linuxgamingcentral) -- useful for one-time payments. Similar to Patreon, you will get access to the private Discord channel for one-time or monthly payments

Your support is greatly appreciated!
